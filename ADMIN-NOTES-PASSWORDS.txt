ADMIN NOTES: Customer Password System
============================================

FOR YOUR REFERENCE ONLY - Don't share this file with customers!

--------------------------------------------
PASSWORD OPTIONS
--------------------------------------------

You have TWO options for giving customers their passwords:

OPTION 1: Same Password for Everyone
â€¢ Just give everyone: SUGAR
â€¢ Simplest approach
â€¢ Less tracking needed
â€¢ Perfect for MVP

OPTION 2: Unique Passwords for Tracking
â€¢ Give each customer a unique variant:
  - Customer 1: SUGAR-001
  - Customer 2: SUGAR-002
  - Customer 3: SUGAR-003
  - etc.

â€¢ All passwords still work (any password starting with "SUGAR")
â€¢ Helps you track who's using what
â€¢ Better for analytics later

--------------------------------------------
HOW TO CUSTOMIZE THE DELIVERY FILES
--------------------------------------------

The two customer instruction files are:
1. CUSTOMER-INSTRUCTIONS.txt (full version)
2. CUSTOMER-INSTRUCTIONS-EMAIL.txt (email version)

If using unique passwords:

1. Copy one of these files
2. Replace "SUGAR" with "SUGAR-001" (or whatever number)
3. Save as a unique file per customer
4. Upload to Polar.sh for that specific purchase

OR

Use Polar.sh's variable system (if available):
â€¢ Set up a counter variable {{order_number}}
â€¢ Use password: SUGAR-{{order_number}}
â€¢ Automatically unique for each customer

--------------------------------------------
TESTING DIFFERENT PASSWORDS
--------------------------------------------

All of these work RIGHT NOW:
âœ“ SUGAR
âœ“ SUGAR-001
âœ“ SUGAR-002
âœ“ SUGARsaint
âœ“ sugar123
âœ“ SUGAR-test
âœ“ Literally anything starting with "SUGAR"

You don't need to set up individual passwords - they all work automatically.

--------------------------------------------
MINTLIFY URL CONFIGURATION
--------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: Before deploying, update your Mintlify URL!

1. Open: lib/config.ts
2. Replace the placeholder URL with your actual Mintlify URL:

   Example:
   export const MINTLIFY_URL = 'https://sugarsaint.mintlify.app'

   Or if using custom domain:
   export const MINTLIFY_URL = 'https://docs.sugarsaint.bio'

3. Save the file
4. This is where users will be redirected after login

--------------------------------------------
POLAR.SH SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------

1. Log in to Polar.sh dashboard
2. Go to your SugarSaint product settings
3. Look for "Digital Delivery" or "Email After Purchase"
4. Upload or paste the content from:
   CUSTOMER-INSTRUCTIONS-EMAIL.txt

5. Set subject line:
   "Your SugarSaint Course Access - Welcome! ðŸŽ‰"

6. Test with a free purchase to yourself first
7. Check that the email arrives properly
8. Click the link and test login with "SUGAR"

--------------------------------------------
RECOMMENDED APPROACH FOR MVP
--------------------------------------------

KEEP IT SIMPLE:
â€¢ Use same password for everyone: SUGAR
â€¢ Upload CUSTOMER-INSTRUCTIONS-EMAIL.txt to Polar
â€¢ Done!

After ~10 sales, upgrade to:
â€¢ Individual license keys OR
â€¢ Full user authentication system

--------------------------------------------
BACKUP PLAN
--------------------------------------------

If Polar.sh doesn't support automatic delivery:

1. Manually email each customer after purchase
2. Copy/paste from CUSTOMER-INSTRUCTIONS-EMAIL.txt
3. Send from support@sugarsaint.bio (or your email)
4. Keep a spreadsheet of who you sent to

--------------------------------------------
SUPPORT EMAIL SETUP
--------------------------------------------

You mentioned support@sugarsaint.bio in the instructions.

Make sure this email exists and forwards to you!

Options:
â€¢ Set up via your domain registrar
â€¢ Forward to patrick.k.wenk@gmail.com
â€¢ Or replace with your actual support email

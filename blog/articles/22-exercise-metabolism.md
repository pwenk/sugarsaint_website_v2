# How Does Exercise Affect Metabolism and When Is It Harmful?

## TL;DR

Exercise is stress. High-intensity training without adequate recovery suppresses thyroid function and raises cortisol. You get cold, tired, and stop losing weight. Low metabolism can't support intense training. Fix metabolism first with PUFA elimination and adequate food. Then add exercise gradually. Walking and strength training beat cardio for metabolic health.

You're training harder than ever.

Running five days per week. HIIT classes. Spin. CrossFit.

You should be losing weight. Getting stronger. Feeling energized.

Instead you're exhausted. Cold all the time. Gaining weight despite burning 500 calories per workout.

Your period disappeared. Your libido crashed. You can't sleep.

You're not under-training. You're overtraining on a suppressed metabolism.

*Exercise is like accelerating a car. If the engine is broken, pressing the gas just makes smoke.*

## What Exercise Does to Your Body

Exercise is a stressor. It triggers a stress response.

**Acute stress (one workout):**
- Cortisol rises
- Adrenaline increases
- Body mobilizes energy
- After recovery: adaptation occurs (you get stronger, fitter)

**Chronic stress (too much training, inadequate recovery):**
- Cortisol stays elevated
- [Thyroid function suppresses (your body protects itself from excessive energy expenditure)](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- Metabolism slows
- Adaptation stops
- You break down faster than you recover

This is overtraining syndrome.

## The Metabolism Problem

Your metabolic rate determines how much stress you can handle.

**High metabolism (good thyroid function):**
- [Warm body temperature (98°F)](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- [Strong pulse (75-85 bpm)](/blog/pulse-tracking-guide)
- Good energy and recovery
- Can handle intense training

**Low metabolism (suppressed thyroid):**
- Cold body temperature (below 97.8°F)
- Weak pulse (below 70 bpm)
- Poor energy and slow recovery
- Cannot handle intense training without further suppression

If you exercise intensely with low metabolism, you dig a deeper hole. Your body sees exercise as a threat. It suppresses metabolism further to conserve energy.

## What Overtraining Looks Like

**Physical signs:**
- Chronic fatigue despite adequate sleep
- Cold hands and feet, even during exercise
- Weight gain or inability to lose fat
- Loss of strength or performance plateau
- Frequent injuries or illnesses
- Slow wound healing

**Hormonal signs:**
- Women: irregular or missing periods
- Men: low libido, erectile dysfunction
- Both: low testosterone, elevated cortisol

**Metabolic signs:**
- [Low morning temperature (below 97.8°F)](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- Elevated resting pulse (above 90 bpm) or very low pulse (below 65 bpm)
- Poor sleep despite being exhausted
- Waking at 2-4 AM with racing thoughts

**Performance signs:**
- Workouts feel harder than they should
- Can't hit previous numbers
- Recovery takes days instead of hours

## When Exercise Helps vs. Hurts

**Exercise helps metabolism when:**
- You're adequately recovered
- You're eating enough food (especially carbs)
- Your body temperature and pulse are healthy
- You have good energy before the workout
- You feel energized (not depleted) after

**Exercise hurts metabolism when:**
- You're chronically stressed
- You're under-eating or low-carb
- Your temperature and pulse are already low
- You're forcing yourself to train through exhaustion
- You feel worse after workouts

[PUFAs make this worse](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat). They suppress thyroid function directly. Then you add exercise stress on top. Your metabolism crashes.

## The Right Exercise for Metabolic Health

**Walking:** Best exercise for almost everyone. Low stress. Improves insulin sensitivity. Supports lymphatic flow. Doesn't suppress metabolism. Aim for 8,000-10,000 steps daily.

**Strength training:** 2-4x per week. Heavy weights, low reps, long rest periods. Builds muscle without excessive cortisol response. Stop before complete fatigue.

**Sprints (if healthy):** Very short, very intense, lots of recovery. 10-20 second efforts, 2-3 minute rest. Once or twice per week. Only if metabolism is good.

**Avoid:**
- Long-duration cardio (running 60+ minutes, long bike rides)
- Daily HIIT classes
- Training through exhaustion or illness
- Fasted training (further stresses metabolism)
- Multiple workouts per day

## How to Fix Exercise + Metabolism

**Step 1: Fix metabolism first.**
[Eliminate PUFAs completely](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). Eat adequate carbohydrates. Support thyroid function. Wait until your temperature climbs toward 98°F and energy improves. This might take 4-8 weeks.

**Step 2: Reduce training volume.**
Cut intensity and frequency by 50%. If you're running 5x per week, drop to 2-3x. If you're doing HIIT 4x per week, drop to 1-2x. Replace with walking.

**Step 3: Track your signals.**
[Temperature and pulse daily](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). Energy levels. Recovery quality. If these worsen with exercise, you're doing too much.

**Step 4: Add food, especially carbs.**
You need glucose to support thyroid function and recovery. Fruit, potatoes, rice, honey. Eat enough protein (0.8-1g per pound of body weight). Don't restrict calories.

**Step 5: Prioritize sleep and stress management.**
[Poor sleep suppresses metabolism more than exercise helps](/blog/body-temperature-sleep). Fix sleep first.

**Step 6: Gradually increase training as metabolism improves.**
When temperature is stable at 98°F, pulse is 75-85 bpm, and energy is good, slowly add training volume. Increase by 10-20% every 2-3 weeks. Track your signals.

Most people find they can train much harder once metabolism is optimized. But they need less training than they thought. Quality over quantity.

## What About Fat Loss

You can't outrun a broken metabolism.

**The calories-in-calories-out myth:** Exercise burns calories. But it also increases hunger and stress hormones. If your metabolism is suppressed, your body compensates by lowering energy expenditure elsewhere. You burn 300 calories running. Your body reduces your resting metabolic rate by 300 calories. Net zero.

**The metabolic approach:** Fix thyroid function. Your resting metabolic rate increases. You burn more calories 24/7 without trying. Fat loss happens naturally without excessive exercise.

Walking helps. Strength training helps (builds metabolically active muscle). But hours of cardio per week isn't necessary and often counterproductive.

## FAQ

**Q: I'm training for a marathon. Should I stop?**
A: Endurance training is inherently stressful to metabolism. If you're committed, prioritize recovery: adequate carbs, enough calories, quality sleep, minimal other stress. Monitor temperature and pulse. But know that marathon training often suppresses metabolism temporarily.

**Q: Can I do yoga or Pilates?**
A: Yes, these are generally low-stress. Good for flexibility and core strength. Watch hot yoga—some people find the heat stress excessive when metabolism is already compromised.

**Q: What if I love running/cycling/HIIT?**
A: Fix your metabolism first. Once temperature and pulse are optimized, you can return to activities you love. But you may need less volume than before. Listen to your body's signals.

**Q: How much protein do I need for strength training?**
A: 0.8-1g per pound of body weight. Get it from meat, eggs, dairy, fish. Don't over-rely on protein shakes—whole food is better. Make sure you're eating enough carbs too. Protein alone isn't enough.

# How to Optimize Athletic Performance Through Metabolism

## TL;DR

Athletes need high metabolic rate for performance. PUFAs suppress thyroid and increase inflammation—both kill performance. Optimize metabolism first: eliminate PUFAs, adequate carbs, quality protein, saturated fats. Then train. Recovery improves. Strength increases. Endurance builds. Performance peaks.

---

You're training harder than ever.

Five days per week. Six days. Pushing limits. Tracking macros. Taking supplements.

Your performance plateaued. Or declined. You're slower. Weaker. Can't recover.

You thought more training was the answer. It's not.

[Your metabolism is broken](/blog/exercise-metabolism).

*Athletic performance is like a race car. Training is the driver. Metabolism is the engine. The best driver can't win with a broken engine.*

## Metabolism Determines Performance Capacity

**High metabolic rate:**
- [Warm body temperature (98°F+)](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- [Strong pulse (75-85 bpm at rest)](/blog/pulse-tracking-guide)
- High energy production (mitochondrial function)
- Fast recovery
- Efficient nutrient use
- Hormone optimization

**Low metabolic rate:**
- Cold temperature
- Weak or high pulse
- Poor energy production
- Slow recovery
- [Overtraining despite moderate volume](/blog/exercise-metabolism)
- [Hormonal suppression](/blog/testosterone-pufas)

**You can't out-train bad metabolism.**

## How PUFAs Kill Athletic Performance

**They suppress thyroid.**
[Low T3 means low energy production](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Mitochondria can't make ATP efficiently. Power output drops.

**They cause inflammation.**
[Chronic inflammation impairs recovery](/blog/pufas-inflammation). Muscles stay sore longer. Joints hurt. [Performance declines](/blog/joint-pain-pufas).

**They damage mitochondria.**
[PUFAs oxidize in mitochondrial membranes](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress). Energy production slows. Endurance suffers.

**They impair protein synthesis.**
[Damaged gut from PUFAs reduces protein absorption](/blog/pufas-gut-health). Muscle growth slows despite adequate protein intake.

**They lower testosterone.**
[Men: reduced power and strength](/blog/testosterone-pufas). [Women: reduced performance and increased injury risk](/blog/pufas-womens-hormones).

## What Elite Athletes Did (Before Seed Oils)

Traditional athletes ate:
- Meat, eggs, dairy
- Potatoes, rice, fruit
- Butter, lard, tallow
- **No seed oils**

**Their performance:**
- Olympic records from 1950s-1970s still stand
- Strength athletes were massive and powerful
- Endurance athletes recovered faster

**Modern athletes:**
- Eat seed oils constantly
- [Carb-load with pasta cooked in vegetable oil](/blog/reading-food-labels)
- [Protein shakes with soybean oil](/blog/meal-planning)
- ["Healthy" energy bars with sunflower oil](/blog/reading-food-labels)

**Result:**
More injuries. Slower recovery. Need more supplements to compensate.

## How to Eat for Performance

**Eliminate seed oils completely.**
[Every restaurant meal, every packaged snack contains them](/blog/restaurant-pufa-guide). [Cook all food yourself](/blog/meal-planning).

**Eat adequate carbohydrates.**
- [Thyroid needs glucose](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- Muscles need glycogen
- [Brain needs fuel for focus](/blog/brain-fog-pufas)
- 3-5g per kg body weight for athletes

**Protein:**
- 1.6-2.2g per kg body weight for strength/muscle building
- 1.2-1.6g per kg for endurance
- From meat, eggs, dairy, fish (not powders mixed with seed oils)

**Fats:**
- Butter, coconut oil, ghee
- Animal fats from meat
- Egg yolks
- 20-30% of calories

**[Salt liberally.](/blog/electrolytes-salt)**
Athletes lose sodium through sweat. Replace it.

**Meal timing:**
- Eat before training (2-3 hours)
- Eat after training (within 1-2 hours)
- [Don't train fasted if performance matters](/blog/intermittent-fasting)

## Training With Optimized Metabolism

**Recovery improves:**
- Soreness reduces
- Sleep quality increases
- Muscles rebuild faster
- [Fewer injuries](/blog/joint-pain-pufas)

**Performance increases:**
- More power output
- Better endurance
- Improved focus
- Faster times/higher weights

**Hormones optimize:**
- [Men: higher testosterone](/blog/testosterone-pufas)
- [Women: regular cycles, better energy](/blog/pufas-womens-hormones)
- Both: better sleep, mood, recovery

**Less is more:**
[With optimized metabolism, training quality improves](/blog/exercise-metabolism). Need less volume. Get better results.

## What About Supplements

**Unnecessary if metabolism is optimized:**
- Pre-workout (just need food)
- BCAAs (complete protein is better)
- Most commercial recovery drinks (contain seed oils)

**Potentially helpful:**
- Creatine (5g daily, improves power output)
- [Magnesium glycinate (if deficient, helps sleep)](/blog/electrolytes-salt)
- [Vitamin D (if deficient from labs)](/blog/calcium-vitamin-d)
- Collagen/gelatin (supports connective tissue)

**Fix diet first.** Supplements are 5% max.

## Endurance vs. Strength

**Endurance athletes:**
Need even more carbs (5-7g per kg body weight). [Chronic cardio suppresses thyroid](/blog/exercise-metabolism). Mitigate with:
- Adequate calories (don't under-eat)
- [Enough carbs for thyroid](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Quality sleep](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)
- [Periodic lower-volume weeks](/blog/exercise-metabolism)

**Strength athletes:**
Build muscle better with:
- High protein (1.8-2.2g per kg)
- [Adequate carbs (glycogen for training)](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Saturated fats for hormone production](/blog/testosterone-pufas)
- Progressive overload without overtraining

Both need optimized metabolism.

## Recovery Markers to Track

**[Temperature:](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)**
Should stay 98°F+ even during hard training. If drops, reduce volume or increase food.

**[Pulse:](/blog/pulse-tracking-guide)**
Should be 75-85 at rest. Above 90 = overtraining. Below 70 = suppressed metabolism.

**Sleep:**
Fall asleep easily. [Sleep through night](/blog/body-temperature-sleep). Wake refreshed. If not, reduce training or address metabolism.

**Appetite:**
Should be hungry. Good sign. Eat to satiety. If appetite disappears, you're overtrained.

**Mood:**
[Stable, positive](/blog/anxiety-pufas). [If irritable or depressed](/blog/anxiety-pufas), check recovery.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to carb-load before competition?**
A: If your glycogen stores are full from eating adequate daily carbs, you don't need special carb-loading. Eat normal high-carb meals 2-3 days before event.

**Q: What about protein timing (anabolic window)?**
A: Total daily protein matters more than timing. But eating protein within 1-2 hours post-training optimizes muscle protein synthesis. Don't stress about 30-minute windows.

**Q: Can I build muscle on this approach?**
A: Yes. [High protein, adequate carbs for training, progressive overload](/blog/meal-planning). [Many athletes build muscle faster once metabolism is optimized](/blog/testosterone-pufas).

**Q: What if my sport requires weight class?**
A: Optimize metabolism first at normal weight. Then cut weight strategically (final 2-3 weeks). Don't chronically restrict to maintain weight class—[kills metabolism and performance](/blog/low-carb-thyroid).

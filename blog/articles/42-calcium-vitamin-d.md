# Do You Need Calcium and Vitamin D Supplements for Bone Health?

## TL;DR

Most people don't need calcium supplements. Dairy, bones (bone broth), and leafy greens provide enough. Vitamin D from sun is ideal. Supplement if deficient (test first). But bone health requires more than calcium and D: adequate protein, saturated fat, thyroid function, and weight-bearing exercise. PUFAs impair calcium absorption and bone formation. Fix that first.

Your doctor says your bone density is low.

She prescribes calcium and vitamin D. Maybe a bisphosphonate drug if it's really bad.

You take them. For months. For years.

Your bones don't improve much. Sometimes they get worse.

The supplements aren't fixing the problem. [Your metabolism is broken](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

*Bone health is like building a house. Calcium is bricks. But you also need foundation, frame, and workers. PUFAs fire the workers.*

## What Bones Actually Need

Bones aren't just calcium. They're living tissue that constantly remodels.

**Components of healthy bones:**
- Calcium (mineral structure)
- Phosphorus (mineral structure)
- Collagen (protein matrix that holds minerals)
- Vitamin D (helps absorb calcium)
- Vitamin K2 (directs calcium to bones, not arteries)
- Magnesium (needed for calcium metabolism)
- Boron (supports bone formation)

**Hormones needed:**
- Thyroid hormone (regulates bone turnover)
- Growth hormone (builds bone)
- Sex hormones (estrogen, testosterone protect bones)
- Parathyroid hormone (regulates calcium)

**Mechanical stress:**
- Weight-bearing exercise creates signals for bone building
- Bones respond to load by getting stronger

[PUFAs disrupt all of this](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress).

## How PUFAs Damage Bones

**They suppress thyroid function.**
[Low thyroid slows bone formation](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Your bones don't rebuild as fast as they break down. Osteoporosis develops.

**They cause inflammation.**
[Chronic inflammation increases osteoclast activity](/blog/pufas-inflammation) (cells that break down bone). More breakdown, less formation.

**They impair protein synthesis.**
[Damaged gut from PUFAs means poor protein absorption](/blog/pufas-gut-health). You can't make collagen matrix. Bones become brittle.

**They reduce sex hormones.**
[PUFAs lower testosterone in men](/blog/testosterone-pufas). [Lower estrogen effectiveness in women](/blog/pufas-womens-hormones). Both sex hormones protect bone density.

**They impair nutrient absorption.**
[Leaky gut and inflammation reduce absorption](/blog/pufas-gut-health) of calcium, magnesium, vitamin D, and other bone nutrients.

## Calcium: Food vs. Supplements

**Best food sources:**
- Dairy (milk, cheese, yogurt): 300mg per cup of milk
- Bone-in fish (sardines, salmon): 200-400mg per serving
- Bone broth: varies, but significant if bones are cooked long
- Leafy greens (kale, collards): 100-200mg per serving

**Needs:**
- Adults: 1000-1200mg per day
- Postmenopausal women: 1200mg per day

**From food:**
- 3 cups dairy = 900mg
- 1 serving sardines = 300mg
- Total: 1200mg easily

**Supplements:**
- Calcium carbonate (needs stomach acid to absorb)
- Calcium citrate (absorbs better, doesn't need acid)

**Problems with supplements:**
- Can cause constipation
- May increase heart disease risk (calcium deposits in arteries)
- Doesn't fix poor absorption from gut issues
- Crowds out other minerals (iron, zinc, magnesium)

**Better approach:**
Eat dairy. Drink bone broth. [Fix your gut so you absorb calcium properly](/blog/pufas-gut-health).

## Vitamin D: Sun vs. Supplements

**Vitamin D functions:**
- Helps absorb calcium from gut
- Regulates immune function
- Supports mood
- Needed for hormone production

**Best source: Sun**
- 15-30 minutes of midday sun on arms and legs
- Makes 10,000-25,000 IU
- Can't overdose from sun
- Free

**Supplement needs:**
- Test first (25-OH vitamin D)
- Optimal: 40-60 ng/mL (some say 50-80 ng/mL)
- Deficient: Below 30 ng/mL

**If supplementing:**
- Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), not D2
- 2,000-5,000 IU per day if deficient
- Take with fat (fat-soluble vitamin)
- Retest after 3 months

**Don't megadose blindly.**
Too much vitamin D can cause hypercalcemia (too much calcium in blood). This actually harms bones and kidneys.

## What About Vitamin K2

K2 directs calcium to bones instead of soft tissues (arteries, kidneys).

**Food sources:**
- Natto (fermented soybeans): highest source, 1000mcg per serving
- Grass-fed butter and ghee: 15mcg per tablespoon
- Egg yolks from pasture-raised chickens: 30mcg per yolk
- Hard cheeses: 75mcg per ounce
- Liver: 5-10mcg per serving

**Needs:**
- 90-200mcg per day

**From food:**
- Butter, eggs, cheese, meat from grass-fed/pastured animals
- Most people get 10-50mcg per day (low)

**Supplement:**
- MK-4 or MK-7 forms
- 100-200mcg per day if not eating natto or grass-fed dairy regularly

**Important for:**
- People taking high-dose vitamin D
- People with cardiovascular disease (prevents arterial calcification)
- Postmenopausal women (bone protection)

## The Thyroid-Bone Connection

[Thyroid hormone regulates bone turnover](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

**Hypothyroidism (low thyroid):**
- Slows bone formation
- Bones don't rebuild fast enough
- Osteoporosis develops slowly

**Hyperthyroidism (high thyroid):**
- Increases bone breakdown
- Bones break down faster than they rebuild
- Osteoporosis develops quickly

**Optimal thyroid function:**
- Balanced bone formation and breakdown
- Healthy bone density maintained

[Fix thyroid function first](/blog/thyroid-medication). [Eliminate PUFAs](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). [Support with adequate carbs](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Then worry about calcium supplements.

## Weight-Bearing Exercise

Bones respond to mechanical stress. No stress = weak bones.

**Best for bones:**
- Walking (weight of body loads bones)
- [Strength training with weights](/blog/exercise-metabolism)
- Running or jumping (impact loading)
- Dancing, hiking, stairs

**Not enough:**
- Swimming (no impact)
- Cycling (seated, no impact)
- Yoga alone (good for balance, not bone loading)

**How much:**
- [Strength train 2-4x per week](/blog/exercise-metabolism)
- Walk daily
- Progressive overload (gradually increase weight)

Bones build in response to load. Give them load.

## What About Osteoporosis Drugs

**Bisphosphonates (Fosamax, Boniva, Reclast):**
- Slow bone breakdown
- Increase bone density on scans
- But create brittle bones (quality is poor)
- Side effects: jaw osteonecrosis, atypical fractures
- Don't fix root cause

**Prolia (denosumab):**
- Monoclonal antibody that stops bone breakdown
- Works differently than bisphosphonates
- Rebound fractures if stopped
- Doesn't fix root cause

**Our take:**
These drugs have a place for severe osteoporosis with fracture risk. But they should be last resort, not first line.

**Try first:**
- [Eliminate PUFAs](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge)
- [Optimize thyroid](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- Eat adequate protein (1g per pound body weight)
- [Strength train](/blog/exercise-metabolism)
- Get vitamin D to optimal range
- Eat calcium-rich foods

Give this 6-12 months. Retest bone density. Many people improve without drugs.

## Protein Matters More Than You Think

Bones are 50% protein (collagen). Not just calcium.

**Low protein:**
- Can't make collagen matrix
- Bones are porous and brittle
- Fracture easily even with normal calcium

**Adequate protein:**
- 0.8-1g per pound body weight
- Higher for elderly (1-1.2g per pound)
- From meat, eggs, dairy, fish
- Collagen/gelatin helpful (bone broth)

Many elderly people with osteoporosis are simply under-eating protein. They restrict meat because they're not hungry ([low thyroid suppresses appetite](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)).

[Fix metabolism, appetite returns, protein intake increases](/blog/meal-planning), bones improve.

## FAQ

**Q: I'm lactose intolerant. How do I get calcium?**
A: Hard cheese is low lactose. Bone-in fish (sardines, canned salmon). Bone broth. Leafy greens (though absorption is lower). Lactose-free milk if needed. Or supplement calcium citrate.

**Q: Can I take too much calcium?**
A: Yes. Above 2,000mg per day can cause constipation, kidney stones, and arterial calcification. Stick to 1,000-1,200mg from food primarily. Supplement only if dietary intake is low.

**Q: What about magnesium for bones?**
A: Also important. Needed for calcium metabolism. Get from dark chocolate, nuts (if tolerated), leafy greens, meat. Or supplement magnesium glycinate 300-400mg per day if deficient.

**Q: How long until bone density improves?**
A: Bones remodel slowly. Expect 6-12 months minimum. Retest DEXA scan after 1-2 years of metabolic optimization and strength training. Don't expect fast results. Focus on preventing further loss while slowly rebuilding.

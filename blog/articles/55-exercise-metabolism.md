# Why Is Exercise Making You Tired? Overtraining and Metabolism

## TL;DR

Exercise should give you energy. If it drains you, your metabolism is broken. Chronic cardio suppresses thyroid. Overtraining raises cortisol. You need metabolic capacity to recover from training. Fix metabolism first: eliminate PUFAs, support thyroid, eat adequate calories. Then train. Less volume, better results.

---

You're training six days per week.

Running. Lifting. CrossFit. Spin class. Orange Theory. Following the program perfectly.

You're not getting stronger. You're getting weaker. More tired. Slower. Can't recover.

You thought you needed to train harder. Push through. "No pain, no gain."

You're overtraining. Your metabolism can't support the volume.

*Exercise is like driving a car fast. High performance requires a strong engine. Your engine is broken. Pushing the gas harder just breaks it more.*

## Exercise Requires Metabolic Capacity

**To benefit from exercise, you need:**
- [High thyroid function (energy production)](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Adequate glycogen stores (fuel for training)](/blog/meal-planning)
- [Strong mitochondria (ATP generation)](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress)
- Low inflammation (fast recovery)
- [Balanced hormones (testosterone, growth hormone)](/blog/testosterone-pufas)

**When metabolism is broken:**
- [Low thyroid can't meet energy demands](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- Glycogen depletes faster, recovers slower
- [Mitochondria are damaged](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress)
- [Chronic inflammation impairs recovery](/blog/pufas-inflammation)
- [Hormones dysregulate (high cortisol, low testosterone)](/blog/anxiety-pufas)

**You can't out-train broken metabolism.**

## How Exercise Suppresses Thyroid

**Chronic cardio (long duration, moderate intensity):**
- Increases cortisol
- [Cortisol suppresses T4-to-T3 conversion](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- Metabolism slows to conserve energy
- Training becomes harder despite more volume

**High-intensity training (when overdone):**
- Depletes glycogen repeatedly
- Body perceives starvation
- [Thyroid downregulates to conserve energy](/blog/low-carb-thyroid)

**Undereating + overtraining:**
- Worst combination
- [Thyroid crashes](/blog/intermittent-fasting)
- [Performance tanks](/blog/athletic-performance)
- [Body breaks down muscle for fuel](/blog/meal-planning)

## Signs You're Overtraining

**[Temperature drops:](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)**
Morning temperature below 97.8°F signals suppressed metabolism. Training is exceeding recovery capacity.

**[Pulse stays elevated:](/blog/pulse-tracking-guide)**
Resting pulse above 90 bpm means high stress hormones. You're not recovering.

**[Sleep worsens:](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)**
Can't fall asleep. Wake frequently. Never feel rested.

**[Performance declines:](/blog/athletic-performance)**
Weights feel heavier. Run times slow. Can't hit previous numbers.

**Constant soreness:**
Muscles never fully recover. [Joints ache](/blog/joint-pain-pufas). Chronic inflammation.

**[Mood changes:](/blog/anxiety-pufas)**
Irritable. Depressed. [Anxious](/blog/anxiety-pufas). Low motivation.

**Frequent illness:**
Catching every cold. Immune system suppressed.

**[Women: period irregularity or loss](/blog/pufas-womens-hormones):**
Missing periods signals severe metabolic suppression.

**If you have 3+ of these, you're overtrained.**

## PUFAs Make Overtraining Worse

[PUFAs suppress thyroid baseline](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Add training stress. Thyroid crashes faster.

**[PUFAs also:](/blog/pufas-inflammation)**
- Increase inflammation (slower recovery)
- [Damage mitochondria (less energy production)](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress)
- [Impair protein synthesis (less muscle growth)](/blog/pufas-gut-health)
- [Reduce testosterone (worse strength adaptation)](/blog/testosterone-pufas)

**Athletes eating seed oils:**
- Need more recovery time
- Plateau faster
- Injure more easily
- Can't sustain high training volume

[Eliminate PUFAs](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). Metabolic capacity increases. Same training produces better results.

## How to Exercise with Optimized Metabolism

**Fix metabolism first:**
- [Eliminate seed oils](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge)
- [Support thyroid](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Eat adequate calories](/blog/meal-planning)
- [Track temperature (goal: 98°F+)](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)

**Then adjust training:**

**Reduce volume:**
- 3-4 training days per week (not 6-7)
- Shorter sessions (45-60 minutes max)
- More rest days

**Prioritize intensity over duration:**
- Heavy lifting (3-5 reps) better than high-rep circuits
- Sprint intervals better than long steady cardio
- Quality over quantity

**[Eat enough:](/blog/meal-planning)**
- 2,000+ calories minimum for most active people
- Adequate carbs (200-300g daily)
- Protein at each meal (30-50g)
- [Don't train fasted](/blog/intermittent-fasting)

**Monitor recovery:**
- [Temperature stable or rising](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- [Pulse stays 75-85 at rest](/blog/pulse-tracking-guide)
- [Sleep quality good](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)
- [Energy high through day](/blog/energy-crashes)

## Best Exercise Types for Metabolism

**Strength training (2-3x/week):**
- Compound lifts (squat, deadlift, press)
- Lower reps (3-8 range)
- Adequate rest between sets (2-3 minutes)
- [Builds muscle, improves insulin sensitivity](/blog/athletic-performance)

**Walking (daily):**
- Low cortisol impact
- Promotes circulation
- Aids digestion
- Doesn't suppress thyroid

**Sprints (1-2x/week):**
- Short duration (10-30 seconds)
- Full rest between sprints (2-3 minutes)
- Boosts growth hormone and testosterone
- Minimal thyroid suppression

**Avoid:**
- Long cardio (60+ minutes at steady pace)
- Daily high-intensity classes
- [Chronic training without rest days](/blog/athletic-performance)
- Fasted cardio

## Recovery Nutrition

**Pre-training (1-2 hours before):**
- [Protein + carbs (eggs, potato, fruit)](/blog/meal-planning)
- Gives energy for training
- [Prevents cortisol spike](/blog/anxiety-pufas)

**Post-training (within 1-2 hours):**
- Protein + carbs + salt
- [Meat, rice, fruit, salt generously](/blog/electrolytes-salt)
- Replenishes glycogen
- Supports muscle recovery

**Daily:**
- [3 meals minimum](/blog/intermittent-fasting)
- [Adequate carbs at every meal](/blog/low-carb-thyroid)
- [Salt liberally](/blog/electrolytes-salt)

## When to Take a Break

**Deload week (every 4-6 weeks):**
- Reduce volume by 50%
- Maintain intensity
- Allows full recovery

**Complete rest (if overtrained):**
- 1-2 weeks off training
- [Temperature should rise](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- [Sleep should improve](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)
- Energy should return

**Then resume training at lower volume.**

Don't fear losing progress. You'll bounce back stronger with optimized metabolism.

## FAQ

**Q: How much exercise is too much?**
A: [Track temperature and pulse](/blog/tracking-symptoms). If temperature drops below 98°F or pulse stays above 90 resting, reduce volume.

**Q: Can I still do cardio?**
A: Yes, but limit duration. 20-30 minutes max, 2-3x/week. [Long cardio (60+ minutes) suppresses thyroid](/blog/athletic-performance). Walking is fine daily.

**Q: I'm training for a marathon. What do I do?**
A: [Endurance training is inherently thyroid-suppressive](/blog/athletic-performance). Mitigate with: adequate calories, high carbs, periodic lower-volume weeks, [metabolic monitoring](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism).

**Q: Will I lose muscle if I train less?**
A: No. [With optimized metabolism, less training produces better results](/blog/athletic-performance). You'll maintain or build muscle on 3-4 days per week.

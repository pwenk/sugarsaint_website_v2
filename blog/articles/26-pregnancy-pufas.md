# How Do PUFAs Affect Pregnancy and Postpartum Recovery?

## TL;DR

Pregnancy demands massive metabolic resources. PUFAs suppress thyroid function, reduce progesterone, and cause inflammation—all bad for pregnancy. Postpartum recovery requires even more metabolic support. PUFAs worsen postpartum depression, slow healing, and impair milk production. Eliminate seed oils before conceiving and during pregnancy for healthier outcomes and easier recovery.

You're trying to get pregnant.

Or you're pregnant and exhausted. Or you're postpartum and can't recover.

Your hair is falling out. You're cold. Depressed. Can't lose the baby weight. Your milk supply is low.

Everyone says this is normal. "It takes time." "Your body just went through pregnancy."

But your grandmother had six kids and recovered fine. Your body shouldn't be broken.

The difference: she cooked with butter and lard. You've been eating seed oils your entire life.

*Pregnancy is like building a house. PUFAs are rotted lumber. You can't build strong on weak foundation.*

## What Pregnancy Demands Metabolically

Pregnancy requires:
- Massive energy production (creating another human)
- High progesterone (maintains pregnancy)
- Strong thyroid function (supports fetal development)
- Optimal nutrient absorption
- Healthy inflammation regulation

[PUFAs undermine all of these](/blog/pufas-womens-hormones).

**Low thyroid from PUFAs:**
- [Suppresses progesterone production](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- Increases miscarriage risk (progesterone maintains pregnancy)
- Impairs fetal brain development
- Causes extreme fatigue during pregnancy
- Slows postpartum recovery

**PUFA-induced inflammation:**
- [Increases risk of preeclampsia](/blog/pufas-inflammation)
- Worsens nausea and morning sickness
- Impairs placental function
- Affects fetal development

**Damaged cell membranes:**
- Affects nutrient transfer to baby
- Impairs insulin signaling (gestational diabetes risk)
- Slows postpartum healing

## Preparing for Pregnancy

**3-6 months before conceiving:**

**Eliminate PUFAs completely.**
[Switch to butter, coconut oil, ghee](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). Your body needs to rebuild cell membranes with stable fats. This takes 2-3 months minimum.

**Support thyroid function.**
[Eat adequate carbohydrates](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Fruit, potatoes, rice, honey. Get enough iodine (seafood, iodized salt, seaweed). Your thyroid will work harder during pregnancy.

**Build nutrient stores.**
Eat liver once per week (vitamin A, folate, B12, iron). Eat eggs daily (choline for fetal brain). Eat fatty fish occasionally (DHA for brain development, but watch mercury).

**Optimize body temperature and metabolism.**
[Track morning temperature](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). Should be 97.8-98.6°F before conceiving. If low, continue PUFA elimination and metabolic support.

**Get adequate protein.**
0.8-1g per pound body weight. You'll need even more during pregnancy. Start the habit now.

Women who optimize metabolism before pregnancy report:
- Easier conception
- Less severe morning sickness
- More energy during pregnancy
- Easier labor
- Faster postpartum recovery
- Less postpartum depression

## During Pregnancy

**Continue avoiding PUFAs.**
[No seed oils, no restaurant fried food, no packaged snacks](/blog/reading-food-labels). Your baby's cells are being built from the fats you eat. Give them stable building blocks.

**Eat enough food.**
Pregnancy isn't the time to restrict. You need 300-500 extra calories per day in second and third trimesters. Listen to hunger. Don't fear weight gain—you need adequate stores for breastfeeding.

**Prioritize saturated fats and cholesterol.**
Butter, eggs, fatty meat, full-fat dairy. Your baby's brain is 60% fat. Cholesterol is essential for brain development and hormone production.

**Get enough carbohydrates.**
Fruit, potatoes, rice. Your thyroid needs glucose. Low-carb during pregnancy suppresses thyroid and can harm fetal development. This isn't the time for keto.

**Don't fear salt.**
Adequate sodium supports blood volume expansion (you gain 40-50% more blood during pregnancy). Salt to taste. Your body knows what it needs.

**Track temperature if possible.**
[Should stay in optimal range](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). If it drops, increase food intake (especially carbs and protein).

**Manage stress.**
[High cortisol affects pregnancy outcomes](/blog/exercise-metabolism). Adequate rest. Reduce overtraining. Prioritize sleep.

## Postpartum Recovery

This is when metabolic health matters most.

**Postpartum requires MORE metabolic support than pregnancy:**
- Healing from birth trauma
- Producing milk (700+ calories per day)
- Sleep deprivation (massive metabolic stress)
- Hormone shifts (progesterone drops, estrogen fluctuates)
- Nutrient depletion from breastfeeding

**If your metabolism is suppressed from PUFAs:**
- Severe postpartum depression
- Hair loss (thyroid-related)
- Inability to lose weight despite breastfeeding
- Low milk supply
- Extreme fatigue
- Anxiety and mood swings
- Brain fog ("mom brain")

## Supporting Postpartum Metabolism

**Continue PUFA elimination.**
This is not the time to relax standards. Your body is under massive stress. Don't add inflammatory fats.

**Eat MORE than you think you need.**
Breastfeeding burns 500-700 calories per day. Plus healing. Plus sleep deprivation stress. You need abundant food. Focus on nutrient density, not restriction.

**Prioritize protein and fat.**
Minimum 100g protein per day. Liberal saturated fat. Your body is rebuilding tissue and making milk. Give it building blocks.

**Eat adequate carbohydrates.**
[Thyroid function is critical for milk production](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Low-carb tanks milk supply for many women. Eat fruit, potatoes, rice. Don't restrict.

**Get liver and organ meats.**
Replenish nutrient stores. Vitamin A, iron, B vitamins, folate. Liver once per week. Eggs daily.

**Support sleep however possible.**
[Sleep deprivation crashes metabolism](/blog/body-temperature-sleep). Nap when baby naps. Get help with night feedings if possible. Prioritize rest over everything else.

**Don't overtrain.**
Walking is fine. Gentle movement is fine. [Intense exercise suppresses metabolism further](/blog/exercise-metabolism). Wait until you're sleeping better and eating well before adding training.

Most women find postpartum recovery much easier when metabolism is optimized:
- Less or no postpartum depression
- Steady energy despite sleep deprivation
- Healthy milk supply
- Weight naturally normalizes by 6-12 months
- Hair stops falling out
- Mood stabilizes
- Brain function returns

## The Breastfeeding Connection

Milk production requires high metabolic rate.

**Low thyroid = low milk supply** for many women.

[PUFAs suppress thyroid](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Low-carb suppresses thyroid. Under-eating suppresses thyroid.

If you're struggling with milk supply:
- Eliminate PUFAs completely
- Increase carbohydrate intake significantly
- Eat more total food
- [Track temperature](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism) (should be 98°F+)
- Get adequate protein (100g+)
- Rest more

Some women need more aggressive thyroid support (work with a knowledgeable practitioner). But diet fixes the majority of supply issues.

The fats in your breast milk come from your diet. If you eat PUFAs, your milk contains PUFAs. Your baby's brain is building with those fats. Give them saturated fats instead.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I eat PUFAs if I'm not planning to get pregnant for years?**
A: Better to eliminate now. Cell membranes take months to rebuild. If you want optimal fertility and pregnancy outcomes, start preparing well in advance. Plus, you'll feel better now.

**Q: Is fish oil safe during pregnancy?**
A: DHA is important for fetal brain development. But fish oil supplements are highly oxidized. Better to get DHA from eating fatty fish 2-3x per week (choose low-mercury options: salmon, sardines, mackerel). Avoid shark, swordfish, tilefish.

**Q: What if I'm already pregnant and have been eating PUFAs?**
A: Start eliminating them now. Your baby's brain develops most in third trimester. You still have time to provide better building blocks. Don't stress about the past. Focus on what you can control moving forward.

**Q: Will this help with hyperemesis (severe morning sickness)?**
A: Some women find nausea improves with PUFA elimination and metabolic support. Hyperemesis is complex (often thyroid-related). Work with your doctor. But optimizing metabolism can't hurt and might help significantly.

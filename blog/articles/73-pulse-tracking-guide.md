# How to Track Your Pulse to Monitor Metabolism

## TL;DR

Resting pulse reflects metabolic rate and stress levels. Ideal: 75-85 bpm. Below 70 = suppressed metabolism. Above 90 = high stress hormones. Track pulse at rest daily. Combine with temperature for complete metabolic picture. Rising pulse toward 75-85 = healing. Track weekly trends, not daily fluctuations.

You check your pulse.

62 bpm. Your fitness tracker says "excellent resting heart rate."

But you feel terrible. [Exhausted](/blog/energy-crashes). [Cold](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). [Brain foggy](/blog/brain-fog-pufas).

Your tracker is wrong. Low pulse isn't always good.

[Your metabolism is suppressed](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

*Pulse is like engine RPM. Too low, car won't move. Too high, engine overheats. Just right, smooth performance.*

## What Pulse Tells You

**Pulse (heart rate) reflects:**
- Metabolic rate
- [Thyroid function](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Stress hormone levels](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism)
- Cardiovascular health
- Recovery status

**Not just fitness.**

Athletes can have low pulse from training. But low pulse with [fatigue, cold hands, low temperature](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism) = metabolic suppression.

**Context matters.**

## The Ideal Pulse Range

**Optimal resting pulse:**
**75-85 bpm**

This indicates:
- [Adequate thyroid function](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- Good metabolic rate
- [Normal stress hormones](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism)
- Efficient energy production

**Below 70 bpm:**
Often indicates suppressed metabolism:
- [Low thyroid](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Chronic calorie restriction](/blog/intermittent-fasting)
- [Overtraining](/blog/exercise-metabolism)
- [Low body temperature](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)

**Above 90 bpm (at rest):**
Indicates stress response:
- [High cortisol or adrenaline](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism)
- [Overtraining](/blog/exercise-metabolism)
- [Poor sleep](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)
- [Anxiety](/blog/anxiety-pufas)
- Dehydration
- Illness

**"Athlete's heart rate" myth:**

Trained athletes can have pulse 50-60 bpm. This is adaptation, not optimal metabolism.

[Many elite athletes with very low pulse have low thyroid symptoms](/blog/athletic-performance): [fatigue, cold intolerance, depression](/blog/depression-metabolism).

**Lower isn't always better.**

## How to Measure Pulse

**Manual method:**

1. Sit quietly for 5 minutes
2. Find pulse (wrist or neck)
3. Count beats for 60 seconds (or 30 seconds × 2)
4. Record number

**Best times:**
- Morning (after waking, before getting up)
- Mid-afternoon (3-4pm)
- Evening (before bed)

**Wearable devices:**

Fitness trackers, smartwatches provide continuous data.

**Pros:**
- Automatic tracking
- Trend analysis
- Convenient

**Cons:**
- Can be inaccurate (especially at rest)
- Over-focusing on data
- Doesn't replace manual checks

**Use both:** Manual for accuracy, wearable for trends.

## What Different Pulse Patterns Mean

### **Low Pulse (Below 70)**

**With low temperature (below 97.8°F):**
[Metabolic suppression](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). [Thyroid function low](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

**Causes:**
- [Chronic calorie restriction](/blog/intermittent-fasting)
- [Low-carb diet](/blog/low-carb-thyroid)
- [Overtraining](/blog/exercise-metabolism)
- [Hypothyroidism](/blog/thyroid-medication)

**Fix:**
- [Increase food (especially carbs)](/blog/meal-planning)
- [Reduce exercise volume](/blog/exercise-metabolism)
- [Support thyroid](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)

### **High Pulse (Above 90 at rest)**

**With high temperature (99°F+):**
Possible hyperthyroidism or illness.

**With normal/low temperature:**
[Stress response](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism). [Running on adrenaline](/blog/anxiety-pufas).

**Causes:**
- [Chronic stress](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism)
- [Overtraining](/blog/exercise-metabolism)
- [Poor sleep](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)
- [Anxiety](/blog/anxiety-pufas)
- [Caffeine overconsumption](/blog/energy-crashes)
- Dehydration

**Fix:**
- [Reduce stressors](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism)
- [Improve sleep](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)
- [Reduce caffeine](/blog/craving-sugar)
- [Rest days from exercise](/blog/exercise-metabolism)
- [Adequate hydration and salt](/blog/electrolytes-salt)

### **Optimal Pulse (75-85)**

**With good temperature (98-98.6°F):**
[Healthy metabolism](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). Keep doing what you're doing.

**Stable energy all day:**
Metabolically balanced.

## Combining Pulse and Temperature

**Most powerful together:**

| Temperature | Pulse | Interpretation |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| Low (<97.8°F) | Low (<70) | [Metabolic suppression](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism) |
| Low (<97.8°F) | High (>90) | [Stress response masking low metabolism](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism) |
| Normal (98-98.6°F) | Normal (75-85) | [Optimal metabolism](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid) |
| Normal (98-98.6°F) | High (>90) | [Acute stress or overtraining](/blog/exercise-metabolism) |
| High (>99°F) | High (>100) | Illness or hyperthyroidism |

**[Track both daily](/blog/tracking-symptoms).** Patterns emerge over weeks.

## Pulse During Exercise

**Heart rate during training isn't the focus.**

[We care about resting pulse](/blog/tracking-symptoms).

**But if tracking exercise pulse:**
- Max heart rate formulas (220 - age) are rough estimates
- [High resting pulse + can't elevate pulse during exercise](/blog/exercise-metabolism) = [overtraining](/blog/exercise-metabolism)
- [Pulse takes long time to return to baseline](/blog/athletic-performance) = poor recovery

**[Focus on resting pulse for metabolism tracking](/blog/tracking-symptoms).**

## What to Expect During Metabolic Recovery

**Starting point (metabolically suppressed):**
- Pulse: 60-68 bpm
- [Temperature: 96.8-97.6°F](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- [Fatigue, cold, brain fog](/blog/energy-crashes)

**Week 2-4:**
- Pulse may stay low or rise slightly
- [Temperature starts climbing](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- [Energy improves](/blog/energy-crashes)

**Week 5-8:**
- Pulse rises to 70-75 range
- [Temperature approaching 98°F](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- [Symptoms significantly better](/blog/tracking-symptoms)

**Month 3-6:**
- Pulse stabilizes at 75-85 bpm
- [Temperature stable at 98-98.6°F](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- [Energy, sleep, mood all improved](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)

**Rising pulse = recovering metabolism.**

Don't panic if pulse increases from 62 to 78. This is healing.

## Common Mistakes

**Panicking about rising pulse:**
"My pulse went from 60 to 76. Is something wrong?"

No. [This is metabolic recovery](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). [Thyroid improving](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

**Obsessing over daily changes:**
Pulse fluctuates 5-10 bpm daily. [Track weekly averages](/blog/tracking-symptoms).

**Comparing to fitness standards:**
Fitness apps say "excellent" for pulse 50-60. [For metabolism, 75-85 is better](/blog/athletic-performance).

**Ignoring temperature:**
[Pulse without temperature is incomplete picture](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). [Track both](/blog/tracking-symptoms).

## When to See a Doctor

**Resting pulse consistently above 100:**
Rule out hyperthyroidism, heart conditions.

**Resting pulse below 50 with symptoms:**
[Severe hypothyroidism possible](/blog/thyroid-medication).

**Irregular pulse:**
Skipped beats, palpitations. Could be arrhythmia.

**Pulse won't rise despite metabolic interventions:**
[Check thyroid labs](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation). [May need medication](/blog/thyroid-medication).

## FAQ

**Q: My pulse is 68. Is that bad?**
A: [Check temperature](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). [If temperature is 98°F+ and you feel good](/blog/energy-crashes), you're fine. [If temperature low and tired](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism), [increase food and reduce exercise](/blog/meal-planning).

**Q: My fitness tracker says my pulse is 82. Too high?**
A: No. 82 is optimal for metabolism. [Ignore fitness app's "warnings."](/blog/athletic-performance)

**Q: Can medications affect pulse?**
A: Yes. Beta-blockers lower pulse. Thyroid medication can raise it. [Work with doctor if on medications](/blog/thyroid-medication).

**Q: Should I track pulse during exercise?**
A: Optional for training purposes. [But resting pulse is what matters for metabolism tracking](/blog/tracking-symptoms).

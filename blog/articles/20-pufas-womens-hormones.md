# How Do PUFAs Affect Women's Hormones?

## TL;DR

PUFAs suppress thyroid function and increase aromatase activity. This lowers progesterone and raises estrogen. You get estrogen dominance: heavy periods, PMS, breast tenderness, mood swings, weight gain. Eliminating seed oils restores hormone balance within 3-6 months. Most women see cycles normalize, PMS improve, and energy return.

Your periods are hell.

Heavy bleeding. Seven days. Sometimes longer. Clots the size of your palm.

PMS starts two weeks before your period. Bloating. Breast pain. Mood swings that scare you.

Your doctor tested hormones. "Everything's normal."

But you don't feel normal. You feel controlled by your cycle.

The seed oils you've eaten for years are flooding your body with estrogen.

*Hormones are like a symphony. PUFAs are the guy tuning his tuba during the quiet part.*

## What PUFAs Do to Female Hormones

**They suppress thyroid function.** [Low thyroid means low progesterone](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Progesterone is made from pregnenolone, which requires healthy thyroid function. When thyroid drops, progesterone production suffers.

**They increase aromatase activity.** Aromatase is the enzyme that converts testosterone to estrogen. PUFAs make more aromatase. You end up with too much estrogen relative to progesterone.

**They cause inflammation.** [Chronic inflammation disrupts the HPO axis](/blog/pufas-inflammation) (hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary). Your brain can't signal your ovaries properly. Ovulation becomes irregular or doesn't happen.

**They impair liver detoxification.** Your liver breaks down used estrogen. PUFAs damage liver function. Estrogen builds up. You recirculate it instead of eliminating it.

The result: estrogen dominance.

## What Estrogen Dominance Looks Like

**Heavy periods.** Bleeding for 7+ days. Soaking pads or tampons quickly. Large clots. Flooding overnight.

**Long cycles or short cycles.** Normal is 26-32 days. You're at 40 days. Or 21 days. Unpredictable.

**Severe PMS.** Mood swings, irritability, anxiety, depression starting 7-14 days before period. Breast tenderness. Bloating. Headaches.

**Low progesterone symptoms.** Trouble sleeping. Anxiety. Can't handle stress. Short luteal phase (less than 12 days from ovulation to period).

**Fertility issues.** Difficulty getting pregnant despite regular cycles. [Miscarriages (low progesterone can't support pregnancy)](/blog/sperm-quality-pufas).

**Weight gain.** Especially hips, thighs, breasts. Estrogen promotes fat storage in these areas.

**Breast tenderness or fibrocystic breasts.** Painful lumpy breasts, especially before period.

**Mood disorders.** Depression, anxiety, irritability that worsens in luteal phase (after ovulation).

## The Estrogen-Progesterone Ratio

You need BOTH estrogen and progesterone in proper balance.

**Estrogen (first half of cycle):** Builds uterine lining. Thickens cervical fluid. Prepares for ovulation.

**Progesterone (second half of cycle):** Stabilizes uterine lining. Supports potential pregnancy. Calms the nervous system. Opposes estrogen effects.

When progesterone is too low relative to estrogen, you get all the symptoms listed above.

**Causes of low progesterone:**
- Low thyroid function (most common)
- Chronic stress (cortisol steals pregnenolone from progesterone pathway)
- Poor ovulation (if you don't ovulate, you don't make progesterone)
- Inflammation disrupting hormone production

[PUFAs contribute to all of these](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat).

## How to Restore Hormone Balance

**Eliminate seed oils completely.** No canola, soybean, sunflower, safflower, corn oil. These drive the entire problem. [Try the 7-day PUFA purge](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge).

**Cook with saturated fats.** Butter, coconut oil, ghee. These support thyroid function and don't increase aromatase.

**Eat enough carbohydrates.** [Your thyroid needs glucose to function](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Low-carb worsens hormone problems for most women. Eat fruit, potatoes, white rice, honey.

**Support liver detoxification.** Adequate protein (glycine from gelatin helps), B vitamins, cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower). Your liver needs nutrients to break down estrogen.

**Reduce stress.** Chronic cortisol steals from progesterone production. Sleep, rest, manage workload.

**Track your cycle.** Mark day 1 of period. Note ovulation (cervical fluid, temp shift). Track luteal phase length. Monitor symptoms. This shows if you're improving.

Most women see improvements in hormone balance within 3-6 months:
- Periods become lighter and shorter (5 days or less)
- Cycles regulate to 26-32 days
- PMS reduces significantly or disappears
- Energy improves throughout cycle
- Mood stabilizes
- Weight loss becomes possible

## What About Birth Control

Birth control pills suppress your natural hormones entirely. You don't ovulate. You don't make progesterone.

The "period" you get on the pill is withdrawal bleeding, not a real period.

Birth control can mask symptoms. But it doesn't fix the underlying metabolic problem. When you stop the pill, symptoms often return worse than before.

**If you're on birth control:**
- You can still eliminate PUFAs to improve underlying metabolism
- Consider working with a doctor to transition off when ready
- Support your body nutritionally before and during the transition

Many women find they no longer need birth control for symptom management once metabolism is optimized.

## How to Know It's Working

**Tracking matters.** You need data to see progress.

**[Track temperature](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism):** Should climb toward 98°F. Low temperature correlates with low progesterone.

**[Track pulse](/blog/pulse-tracking-guide):** Should be 75-85 bpm at rest. Low pulse means low metabolism.

**Track cycle symptoms:**
- Day 1 of period
- Length of cycle
- Ovulation signs (cervical fluid, temp shift)
- PMS symptoms (rate severity 1-10)
- Period heaviness (light/medium/heavy, number of days)

**Lab testing (optional but useful):**
- Thyroid panel (TSH, Free T3, Free T4, Reverse T3)
- Progesterone on day 21 of cycle (should be above 10 ng/mL)
- Estradiol on day 3 of cycle
- Fasting insulin (check for insulin resistance)

Changes happen gradually. You might notice slightly lighter periods first. Then shorter cycles. Then less PMS. Full optimization takes several months.

## FAQ

**Q: Will eliminating PUFAs cure endometriosis or fibroids?**
A: These are complex conditions. But many women find symptoms improve with PUFA elimination and metabolic optimization. Inflammation decreases. Hormone balance improves. Some women see shrinkage of fibroids. Work with a specialist for comprehensive care.

**Q: Can I take progesterone cream?**
A: Bioidentical progesterone can help short-term while fixing metabolism. But supplementing doesn't address why your body isn't making enough. Fix thyroid function and stress. Your body should produce progesterone naturally.

**Q: I had a hysterectomy. Does this still apply?**
A: If you kept your ovaries, yes. Ovarian function depends on thyroid and metabolic health. If your ovaries were removed, you're on hormone replacement. But metabolic optimization still helps—improves how your body uses hormones.

**Q: How long after eliminating PUFAs until hormones balance?**
A: Most women notice changes within 1-3 cycles (3-6 months). Cell membranes need time to rebuild. Thyroid function needs time to restore. Be patient. Track your data.

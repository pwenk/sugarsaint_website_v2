# Do You Really Need to Avoid Blood Sugar Spikes?"

## TL;DR

Blood sugar "spikes" from fruit and real food aren't dangerous. Your body handles glucose fine when metabolism is healthy. The problem is insulin resistance (from PUFAs and chronic inflammation), not carbohydrates. Eating protein + carb + fat together moderates glucose rise naturally. Don't fear fruit or potatoes. Fear seed oils.

You're tracking blood sugar.

Continuous glucose monitor. Finger pricks. Obsessing over every spike.

"Stay below 140." "Avoid glucose spikes." "Spikes damage your body."

You stopped eating fruit. Potatoes. [Rice](/blog/meal-planning). Anything that raises glucose.

You're exhausted. [Can't think](/blog/brain-fog-pufas). [Craving sugar constantly](/blog/craving-sugar).

Blood sugar stays flat. But you feel terrible.

[Glucose isn't the enemy](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth).

*Blood sugar spikes are like waves in the ocean. Natural. Your body surfs them easily. Unless the surfboard (metabolism) is broken.*

## What "Normal" Blood Sugar Is

**Fasting glucose:**
70-100 mg/dL (ideal: 75-90 mg/dL)

**Post-meal glucose:**
Peak: 120-140 mg/dL (1-2 hours after eating)
Return to baseline: within 2-3 hours

**These ranges are NORMAL.**

Your body is designed to handle glucose fluctuation.

## The "Avoid Spikes" Narrative

**The claim:**
Glucose spikes damage blood vessels. Cause inflammation. Lead to diabetes. Should stay below 120 mg/dL at all times.

**The fear:**
Any rise in blood sugar is harmful.

**The reality:**
[Healthy metabolism handles glucose spikes effortlessly](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). [Rising to 140 mg/dL after eating fruit or rice is NORMAL](/blog/fructose-myth).

**The problem isn't spikes.** [The problem is inability to clear glucose (insulin resistance)](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth).

## What Causes Insulin Resistance

**Not carbs. Not sugar.**

**[The real causes:](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)**
- [PUFAs (oxidized fats damage insulin receptors)](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress)
- [Chronic inflammation](/blog/pufas-inflammation)
- [Low thyroid function](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Sedentary lifestyle](/blog/exercise-metabolism)
- [Chronic stress](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism)
- [Poor sleep](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)

**[Fix these](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). Insulin sensitivity improves. [Glucose handling normalizes](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth).**

## Glucose Spikes from Whole Foods vs. Processed Foods

**[Eating an apple (25g carbs):](/blog/fructose-myth)**
- Glucose rises to 130 mg/dL
- Returns to baseline in 2 hours
- Provides vitamins, fiber, antioxidants
- Normal, healthy response

**Drinking soda (40g sugar + seed oils in accompanying meal):**
- Glucose spikes to 180 mg/dL
- [Stays elevated for 3+ hours](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth)
- [Paired with inflammatory fats](/blog/pufas-inflammation)
- Problematic response (not from glucose, from context)

**Context matters more than glucose number.**

## Your Body Regulates Glucose

**When you eat carbs:**

1. Glucose enters bloodstream
2. Pancreas releases insulin
3. Insulin signals cells to absorb glucose
4. Glucose used for energy or stored as glycogen
5. Blood sugar returns to baseline

**This is NORMAL PHYSIOLOGY.**

[Healthy people handle 50-100g carbs in a meal without issue](/blog/meal-planning).

**Problems arise when:**
- [Cells are insulin resistant (can't absorb glucose)](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Pancreas is exhausted (can't produce enough insulin)](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth)
- [Liver is damaged (can't store glycogen)](/blog/pufas-gut-health)

**[Fix metabolism](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). Glucose regulation improves.**

## Protein + Fat Moderate Glucose Response

**[Eating carbs with protein and fat](/blog/meal-planning):**
- Slows digestion
- Moderates glucose rise
- Extends energy release

**Example:**

**Potato alone:**
- Glucose peaks at 140 mg/dL

**[Potato + steak + butter:](/blog/meal-planning)**
- Glucose peaks at 120 mg/dL
- Slower rise, slower decline
- More sustained energy

**[This is why balanced meals work](/blog/meal-planning).**

[Not because you're "avoiding spikes.](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth)" Because you're providing complete nutrition.

## When Glucose Stays Elevated

**If glucose stays above 140 mg/dL for 3+ hours:**

**Possible causes:**
- Insulin resistance (pre-diabetes, type 2 diabetes)
- [Low thyroid (impairs glucose clearance)](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Chronic stress (cortisol raises glucose)](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism)
- [Overtraining (stress response)](/blog/exercise-metabolism)
- Medications (steroids, etc.)

**This isn't from eating carbs.**

**This is metabolic dysfunction.**

[Fix the root cause](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge):
- [Eliminate PUFAs](/blog/reading-food-labels)
- [Support thyroid](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Reduce stress](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism)
- [Improve sleep](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)
- [Exercise moderately](/blog/exercise-metabolism)

## CGM Obsession

**Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs):**
- Show real-time glucose
- Popular in biohacking community
- Can be useful for diabetics

**Problems with CGM obsession:**
- Anxiety over normal fluctuations
- Fear of healthy foods ([fruit, potatoes](/blog/fructose-myth))
- Missing the forest for the trees

**[Healthy metabolism = glucose self-regulates](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).**

You don't need to micromanage it.

**Better metrics:**
- [Waking temperature](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- [Energy levels through day](/blog/energy-crashes)
- [Sleep quality](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)
- [Mood stability](/blog/anxiety-pufas)
- [Fasting insulin (not glucose)](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth)

## What Actually Matters

**Fasting insulin:**
Measures how hard your body works to maintain normal glucose.
- Ideal: under 5 μIU/mL
- Concerning: above 10 μIU/mL

**High fasting insulin = insulin resistance.**

[Even if fasting glucose is "normal,"](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth) [high insulin indicates metabolic dysfunction](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

**HbA1c:**
3-month average of blood glucose.
- Ideal: under 5.0%
- Pre-diabetes: 5.7-6.4%
- Diabetes: 6.5%+

**[These markers matter more than post-meal spikes](/blog/tracking-symptoms).**

## FAQ

**Q: My glucose goes to 150 after eating rice. Is that bad?**
A: [If it returns to baseline within 2-3 hours, probably fine](/blog/meal-planning). [If stays elevated or you feel terrible, check fasting insulin and thyroid](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation).

**Q: Should I avoid fruit because it spikes glucose?**
A: No. [Fruit is healthy](/blog/fructose-myth). [140 mg/dL spike from fruit is normal](/blog/meal-planning). [Your body handles it](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

**Q: Do I need a CGM?**
A: Only if diabetic or specifically tracking for medical reason. [For most people, unnecessary and anxiety-inducing](/blog/tracking-symptoms). [Track symptoms instead](/blog/tracking-symptoms).

**Q: What if I have insulin resistance?**
A: [Temporarily reducing carbs may help](/blog/low-carb-thyroid). But [eliminating PUFAs is more important](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). [Most people can reintroduce carbs once metabolism heals](/blog/meal-planning).

# What Symptoms Should You Track to Monitor Metabolic Health?

## TL;DR

Track temperature, pulse, energy, warmth, digestion, sleep, and mental clarity daily. These reveal metabolic function better than blood tests. Improvements in these symptoms mean your metabolism is healing. Track for 3-6 weeks to see patterns. Use simple logs, not complicated apps. Your body tells you everything if you listen.

You want to know if you're getting better.

You eliminated seed oils. You're eating more carbs. You switched to butter.

But how do you know it's working?

Lab tests cost money. Doctors take weeks to schedule.

Your body is giving you feedback every single day. You just need to write it down.

*Tracking symptoms is like checking your dashboard while driving. Temperature is your gas gauge. Pulse is your RPM. Ignore them and you run empty.*

## Why Track Symptoms

Blood tests are a snapshot. One moment in time.

Symptoms are continuous data. They show trends. Improvements. Setbacks.

**Lab tests measure what's in your blood.**
**Symptoms measure what your cells are experiencing.**

[You can have "normal" thyroid labs with low cellular thyroid function](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation). But your symptoms reveal the truth: cold hands, low energy, hair loss.

Tracking symptoms gives you:
- Real-time feedback on interventions
- Pattern recognition (what helps, what hurts)
- Motivation (seeing improvement reinforces behavior)
- Data for your doctor (if needed)

## Core Metabolic Indicators to Track

**1. Morning Temperature**
[Measure under tongue first thing](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). Before getting out of bed.

Target: 97.8-98.6°F

Tracks: Thyroid function, metabolic rate

**2. Afternoon Temperature**
2-4 PM, same method.

Target: 98.0-98.8°F (should be higher than morning)

Tracks: Daily metabolic rhythm

**3. Morning Pulse**
[Resting pulse, 60 seconds](/blog/pulse-tracking-guide). Before getting up.

Target: 75-85 bpm

Tracks: Metabolic rate + stress levels

**4. Energy Level**
Rate 1-10 at three times:
- Morning (upon waking)
- Afternoon (2-4 PM)
- Evening (before bed)

Target: 7-9 throughout day, no crashes

Tracks: Metabolic stability, stress response

**5. Physical Warmth**
Rate: Cold / Cool / Comfortable / Warm

Track: Hands, feet, overall body feeling

Target: Comfortably warm throughout day

Tracks: Circulation, thyroid function

**6. Mental Clarity**
Rate 1-10.

Are you focused or foggy? Quick or slow?

Target: 7-10 consistently

Tracks: Brain metabolism, inflammation

**7. Sleep Quality**
- Easy to fall asleep? (Y/N)
- Wake during night? (count times)
- Feel rested? (Y/N)

Target: Fall asleep easily, wake 0-1x, feel rested

[Tracks: Circadian rhythm, metabolic stability](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)

**8. Digestion**
- Bowel movement frequency
- Quality (formed, easy, no urgency)
- Bloating after meals (Y/N)

Target: 1-3x daily, well-formed, no bloating

[Tracks: Gut health, bile production, thyroid](/blog/pufas-gut-health)

**9. Hunger and Satiety**
- How long between meals?
- Ravenous or satisfied?
- Cravings? (type and intensity)

Target: 4-6 hours between meals, satisfied, minimal cravings

Tracks: Blood sugar stability, insulin sensitivity

**10. Mood**
Rate 1-10.

Stable or swinging? Anxious or calm?

Target: 7-10, stable throughout day

Tracks: Neurotransmitter function, inflammation

## How to Track

**Keep it simple.** Complicated systems fail. Use a notebook or simple spreadsheet.

**Example log format:**

```
Date: 10/23/2025

AM Temp: 97.6°F
PM Temp: 98.2°F
AM Pulse: 72 bpm

Energy: Morning 6, Afternoon 7, Evening 5
Warmth: Cool hands, warm body
Mental Clarity: 7
Sleep: Fell asleep easily, woke 2x, tired on waking
Digestion: 1 BM, formed, bloated after lunch
Hunger: 3-4 hours between meals, some sugar cravings
Mood: 6, slightly anxious

Notes: Added more potatoes at lunch. Less bloating than yesterday.
```

**Track for 3 weeks minimum.** One day tells you nothing. Trends matter.

**Look for patterns:**
- Does temperature climb over weeks?
- Does afternoon energy improve?
- Are you warming up?
- Is sleep getting better?

## What Improvement Looks Like

**Week 1-2 (after eliminating PUFAs):**
- Slight warmth improvement
- Hands and feet less cold
- Small energy bump, especially afternoon
- Digestion might change (could go either way initially)

**Week 3-4:**
- Temperature increases 0.2-0.5°F
- Pulse strengthens slightly
- Energy more stable (no crashes)
- Mental clarity noticeably better
- Sleep improves
- Less bloating after meals

**Week 6-8:**
- Temperature approaching 98°F
- Pulse in 75-85 range
- Consistent energy all day
- Warm hands and feet
- Sleep solid
- Digestion regular
- Mood stable

**3-6 months:**
- Temperature consistently 98°F+
- Pulse stable at 75-85
- High energy without stimulants
- Always warm
- Deep sleep
- Perfect digestion
- Mental clarity exceptional

Not everyone improves this fast. Some take longer. But tracking shows you're moving in the right direction.

## What to Do With Your Data

**Improving?** Keep doing what you're doing. Stay the course.

**Plateau or worsening?** Something needs adjustment:
- Still eating hidden PUFAs? [Check labels carefully](/blog/reading-food-labels)
- Enough carbohydrates? [Thyroid needs glucose](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- Enough total food? Under-eating suppresses metabolism
- [Overtraining?](/blog/exercise-metabolism) Reduce exercise volume
- Chronic stress? Address sleep, work, relationships
- [Gut issues?](/blog/pufas-gut-health) May need gut healing protocol

**Share with doctor if needed.** Most doctors don't ask about symptoms. Bring your log. Show trends. This is more valuable than one snapshot lab test.

## Advanced Tracking (Optional)

**For women:**
- Cycle day
- Cervical fluid quality
- Period heaviness and duration
- PMS symptoms

[Tracks: Hormone balance](/blog/pufas-womens-hormones)

**For athletes:**
- Training volume
- Perceived exertion
- Recovery quality
- Performance metrics

[Tracks: Training stress vs. capacity](/blog/exercise-metabolism)

**For specific conditions:**
- Joint pain levels
- Skin condition
- Allergy symptoms
- Any chronic symptoms specific to you

Tracks: Inflammation, immune function

## Common Mistakes

**Tracking too much.** Don't log 30 variables. You'll quit. Stick to core metrics.

**Tracking too little.** Temperature alone isn't enough. You need multiple signals.

**Expecting daily improvement.** Metabolism heals in waves. You'll have good days and setbacks. Track weekly trends, not daily.

**Stopping too soon.** Three days of data is useless. Commit to 3-6 weeks minimum.

**Not writing it down.** "I'll remember" doesn't work. Write it or it didn't happen.

## FAQ

**Q: What if my temperature doesn't improve after 6 weeks?**
A: Check for hidden PUFAs. Increase carbohydrate intake. Consider getting thyroid labs (full panel, not just TSH). Some people need more aggressive intervention. Work with a functional medicine practitioner.

**Q: My temperature is improving but I still feel terrible. Why?**
A: Check pulse. If temperature is rising but pulse is above 90, you're running on stress hormones (adrenaline), not metabolism. Address stress, sleep, overtraining. If pulse is low (below 70), you might need more food.

**Q: Can I use apps to track this?**
A: Sure. But simple notebook often works better. No notifications. No complexity. Just data. Whatever you'll actually use consistently.

**Q: Should I share this with my doctor?**
A: If you have a good doctor, yes. Most doctors appreciate data. But many will dismiss symptoms if labs are "normal." Find a practitioner who understands metabolic health and functional medicine if your current doctor isn't interested.

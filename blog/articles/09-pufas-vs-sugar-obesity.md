# PUFAs vs Sugar: Which Actually Causes Obesity?

## TL;DR

Sugar gets blamed for obesity. But PUFA consumption parallels obesity rates better than sugar does. PUFAs suppress metabolic rate which makes you store more of what you eat. They cause insulin resistance. They're stored as body fat that generates inflammation. Sugar supports thyroid function and metabolic rate when eaten with saturated fats. The villain isn't sugar. It's seed oils.

You cut sugar ten years ago.

You gained weight anyway.

You eat low-carb. Track every calorie. Train five days a week. The weight doesn't budge.

Meanwhile your grandfather ate white bread with butter, drank whole milk, and added sugar to his coffee. He stayed lean his whole life.

What changed wasn't the sugar. It was the fat.

*Your metabolism is a furnace. Sugar is kindling. PUFAs are wet wood that smothers the flame.*

## What the Data Actually Shows

Obesity rates exploded starting in the 1980s. Everyone blames sugar.

But sugar consumption peaked in 1999 and has declined since. Obesity kept rising.

PUFA consumption from seed oils has increased steadily since the 1960s. The correlation is tighter.

1960s: Seed oil consumption low. Obesity rate 13%.
1980s: Seed oil consumption doubles. Obesity rate 23%.
2020s: Seed oil everywhere. Obesity rate 42%.

Sugar stayed relatively constant over that time. Seed oil consumption tripled.

Correlation isn't causation. But when you understand the mechanisms, it makes sense.

## How PUFAs Cause Obesity

**They suppress metabolic rate.** Lower thyroid function means less energy expenditure. You burn fewer calories at rest. What you eat gets stored instead of burned.

**They cause insulin resistance.** PUFA-rich cell membranes don't respond to insulin properly. Glucose can't enter cells efficiently. It gets converted to fat and stored.

**They're preferentially stored as body fat.** Your body doesn't like burning PUFAs. They're unstable. They generate oxidative stress when burned. So your body stores them. The more you eat, the more you store.

**Stored PUFAs generate inflammation.** They oxidize slowly in your fat tissue. This triggers chronic low-grade inflammation. Inflammation makes fat loss harder. It signals your body to hold onto fat stores.

**They disrupt satiety signaling.** Leptin is the hormone that tells your brain you're full. PUFA-rich membranes interfere with leptin signaling. You eat more because you don't feel satisfied.

## How Sugar Supports Metabolism

Sugar gets converted to glucose. Glucose is your body's preferred fuel.

**Glucose supports thyroid function.** You need glucose to convert T4 to T3. Without enough carbs, your thyroid slows down. Metabolic rate drops.

**Glucose prevents stress hormone spikes.** When blood sugar drops, cortisol and adrenaline rise to raise it. These stress hormones promote fat storage, especially around the belly.

**Glucose fuels your brain.** Your brain runs on glucose. When you're low, you feel foggy and tired. You reach for stimulants. Coffee. More sugar. The crash and spike cycle starts.

**Glucose helps burn PUFAs.** When you eat carbs with saturated fats, your body preferentially oxidizes stored PUFAs for energy. This clears them from your system.

The problem isn't sugar. It's sugar combined with seed oils.

## The Combination Is the Problem

Sugar alone: supports metabolism, provides energy, helps thyroid function.

Saturated fat alone: stable, clean-burning, supports hormone production.

Sugar + saturated fat: your body burns the sugar for quick energy and the saturated fat for sustained energy. Good metabolic flexibility.

Sugar + PUFAs: disaster.

The sugar spikes insulin. Insulin tells your body to store fat. The PUFAs you just ate get stored. Those stored PUFAs suppress your metabolism. Now the sugar can't be burned as efficiently. It also gets stored.

This is why donuts make you fat but fruit with butter doesn't.

Donuts: sugar + seed oils.
Fruit with butter: sugar + saturated fat.

Same sugar. Different outcome. The fat is what matters.

## What Your Grandfather Ate

White bread with butter. Whole milk. Meat with potatoes. Desserts made with butter and lard.

High sugar. High saturated fat. Almost zero PUFAs.

He stayed lean because his metabolism ran hot. His thyroid functioned well. His cells responded to insulin. His body burned what he ate instead of storing it.

You eat "healthier" than he did. You avoid butter. You use olive oil and vegetable oil. You eat low-fat yogurt.

You're eating more PUFAs. Your metabolism is suppressed. You store more of what you eat.

You blame the carbs. The problem is the fats.

## What You Do

Stop eating seed oils. Immediately.

Add saturated fats back. Butter. Coconut oil. Ghee. Animal fats.

Eat enough carbohydrates. Don't fear sugar. Your body needs it for thyroid function and energy.

Focus on whole food sources. Fruit. Potatoes. White rice. Honey. Whole milk if you tolerate dairy.

Avoid processed foods that combine sugar and seed oils. Cookies. Chips. Frozen meals. Restaurant food.

If you're eating sugar with saturated fats, your body will handle it well. Your metabolism will rise. You'll burn more calories at rest. Fat loss becomes easier.

Track your temperature. As you swap PUFAs for saturated fats, your temperature should rise. Higher temperature means higher metabolic rate. Higher metabolic rate means easier fat loss.

Most people lose fat more easily on higher carbs with saturated fats than on low-carb with seed oils.

Your grandfather knew this instinctively. He ate butter and sugar and stayed lean.

You can too.

## FAQ

**Q: Won't eating sugar spike my insulin and make me store fat?**
A: Insulin spikes are normal and healthy. They signal your cells to take in glucose for energy. The problem is when your cells are insulin resistant from PUFAs. Fix the insulin resistance first by eliminating seed oils.

**Q: What about fructose being bad for the liver?**
A: Fructose in massive amounts (liters of soda daily) can be problematic. Fruit in normal amounts is not. Your liver handles fructose fine when your metabolism is healthy. PUFAs damage the liver more than fructose does.

**Q: Can I eat as much sugar as I want?**
A: Use common sense. Eat enough for energy and thyroid function. Don't chug soda all day. Fruit, honey, white rice, and potatoes are great sources. Listen to your body.

**Q: Will this work if I have diabetes?**
A: Type 2 diabetes is largely insulin resistance. Eliminating PUFAs improves insulin sensitivity significantly. Many people reduce or eliminate medication. Work with your doctor. Track your blood sugar carefully.

# Why Do Your Joints Hurt? PUFAs and Inflammation

## TL;DR

Joint pain is inflammation. PUFAs accumulate in joint tissue, oxidize, and trigger immune response. Chronic inflammation damages cartilage. Low thyroid slows healing. Eliminate seed oils, joint pain reduces within 4-8 weeks. Full recovery takes 6-12 months as stored PUFAs clear.

Your knees hurt when you climb stairs.

Your hands are stiff in the morning. Your back aches after sitting.

You're too young for arthritis. You're 35. Or 45. Or 55.

Your doctor says it's normal aging. Offers ibuprofen. Maybe physical therapy.

Nothing works long-term. The pain always returns.

Your joints aren't worn out. They're inflamed. [From the fats you eat](/blog/pufas-inflammation).

*Joint pain is like rust on metal. PUFAs are water. Remove the water, treat the rust, metal works again.*

## What Causes Joint Pain

**Normal joint function:**
- Cartilage cushions bones
- Synovial fluid lubricates
- Inflammation stays minimal
- Joints move smoothly

**Chronic inflammation:**
- [PUFAs in joint tissue oxidize](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress)
- Immune system responds
- Inflammatory cytokines flood the joint
- Cartilage breaks down
- Pain and stiffness result

[This isn't "normal aging." It's metabolic dysfunction](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

## How PUFAs Damage Joints

**They accumulate in joint tissue.**
Fat-soluble compounds concentrate in fatty tissues. [PUFAs you eat end up in joint membranes and synovial fluid](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat).

**They oxidize easily.**
[Joints move constantly. Movement creates oxidative stress](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress). PUFAs oxidize. Free radicals damage tissue.

**They trigger immune response.**
Your body detects damaged tissue. Sends inflammatory signals. Joints swell, hurt, become stiff.

**They impair healing.**
[Low thyroid from PUFAs slows tissue repair](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Damage accumulates faster than healing.

## What You Notice

**Morning stiffness:**
Joints are stiff for 30-60 minutes after waking. Improves with movement. Classic inflammatory pattern.

**Pain with activity:**
Knees hurt going down stairs. Hands hurt gripping things. Shoulders hurt reaching overhead.

**Swelling:**
Joints look puffy. Rings don't fit. Knees are visibly swollen.

**Weather sensitivity:**
Pain worsens with cold, damp weather. Barometric pressure changes trigger flares.

**Reduced range of motion:**
Can't bend as far. Can't extend fully. Joints feel "tight."

## Which Joints Hurt Most

**Weight-bearing joints:**
- Knees (most common)
- Hips
- Ankles
- Lower back

**Overused joints:**
- Hands and wrists (if you type, use tools)
- Shoulders (if you lift)
- Elbows

[Pattern matters](/blog/tracking-symptoms). Multiple joints = systemic inflammation (PUFAs). Single joint after injury = local issue.

## How to Reduce Joint Pain

**Eliminate seed oils completely.**
[Stop eating vegetable oil, canola, soybean, sunflower, safflower, corn oil](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). This is non-negotiable.

**Eat saturated fats.**
Butter, coconut oil, ghee. [These don't oxidize and don't trigger inflammation](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat).

**Support thyroid function.**
[Thyroid hormone regulates healing](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). [Eat adequate carbs](/blog/meal-planning). [Track temperature](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism).

**Get adequate protein.**
Cartilage and connective tissue need amino acids. 0.8-1g per pound body weight. Collagen/gelatin helps (bone broth).

**[Move appropriately.](/blog/exercise-metabolism)**
Gentle movement reduces stiffness. But [don't overtrain with inflamed joints](/blog/exercise-metabolism). Walking and swimming are good. Heavy squats with knee pain are not.

**Reduce other inflammatory triggers.**
[Poor sleep worsens inflammation](/blog/body-temperature-sleep). [Stress raises cortisol](/blog/anxiety-pufas). [Fix gut health](/blog/pufas-gut-health).

Most people see joint pain improve:
- Week 2-4: Less severe pain
- Week 6-8: Significant improvement
- Month 4-6: Pain mostly gone
- Month 12: Full recovery as stored PUFAs clear

## What About NSAIDs

Ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin reduce pain by blocking inflammatory enzymes.

**They work.** Short-term.

**Problems:**
- [Damage gut lining (increase leaky gut)](/blog/pufas-gut-health)
- Interfere with healing
- Side effects with long-term use (ulcers, kidney damage)
- Don't address root cause

**Better approach:**
Fix the cause (PUFAs). Use NSAIDs sparingly for severe flares while healing.

## Autoimmune Joint Conditions

Rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis—all autoimmune.

[PUFAs don't cause autoimmunity](/blog/pufas-inflammation). But they worsen it.

**Eliminating PUFAs helps:**
- Reduces systemic inflammation
- [Heals leaky gut (trigger for autoimmunity)](/blog/pufas-gut-health)
- Improves symptom severity

Many people with autoimmune arthritis reduce medication under doctor supervision after eliminating PUFAs. Some go into remission.

**Work with your rheumatologist.** Don't stop disease-modifying drugs without supervision. But dietary changes often allow dose reduction.

## FAQ

**Q: I have osteoarthritis. Will eliminating PUFAs help?**
A: Yes. Osteoarthritis is "wear and tear" but inflammation accelerates it. Reduce inflammation, slow progression significantly.

**Q: How long until joints feel better?**
A: Most people notice improvement within 4-8 weeks. But stored PUFAs in joint tissue take 6-12 months to fully clear. Be patient.

**Q: Should I take glucosamine or chondroitin?**
A: Mixed evidence. They might help some people. But fixing diet is more important. Try that first. Add supplements if needed.

**Q: Can I reverse joint damage?**
A: Severe cartilage loss is hard to reverse. But reducing inflammation stops progression and improves function. Pain decreases even if damage remains.

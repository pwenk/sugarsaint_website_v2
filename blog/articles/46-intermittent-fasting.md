# Does Intermittent Fasting Harm Your Metabolism?

## TL;DR

Intermittent fasting suppresses thyroid in many people, especially women and those with already-low metabolism. Short-term benefits (weight loss, mental clarity) come from stress hormones, not improved metabolism. Long-term fasting worsens thyroid function, disrupts hormones, and slows metabolic rate. Eat regular meals. Support thyroid. Stop relying on restriction.

You're doing 16:8. Or OMAD. Or alternate-day fasting.

The first month was great. Lost weight. Felt sharp. Productive mornings.

Now you're cold. Exhausted. [Hair falling out](/blog/hair-loss-pufas). Can't lose more weight.

Women: period disappeared. Men: [libido crashed](/blog/testosterone-pufas).

Fasting worked. Then it broke you.

*Fasting is like holding your breath. You can do it. But eventually you need to breathe. Your cells need fuel.*

## What Fasting Does to Your Body

**Short-term (first few weeks):**
- Insulin drops (fat burning increases)
- Ketones rise (brain fuel)
- Growth hormone increases (muscle protection)
- Autophagy (cellular cleanup)
- Mental clarity improves

**This is real.** Fasting has benefits.

**Long-term (months):**
- [Thyroid suppresses (T3 drops)](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- Cortisol stays elevated (stress response)
- [Metabolism slows (body adapts to scarcity)](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- Muscle loss (despite growth hormone)
- [Hormones dysregulate](/blog/pufas-womens-hormones)

**Your body doesn't know you're fasting "on purpose."**

It thinks food is scarce. Metabolism slows to conserve energy.

## The Thyroid Problem

[Fasting reduces T3 (active thyroid hormone)](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation).

**Why:**
Your body sees fasting as starvation. It conserves energy by slowing metabolism.

**T3 conversion drops:**
- T4 stops converting to T3
- T4 converts to Reverse T3 instead (inactive, blocks T3)

**Result:**
- [Temperature drops](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- Energy plummets
- [Brain fog](/blog/brain-fog-pufas)
- [Hair loss](/blog/hair-loss-pufas)
- [Can't lose more weight despite fasting](/blog/low-carb-thyroid)

[This pattern is identical to low-carb thyroid suppression](/blog/low-carb-thyroid).

## Women vs. Men

**Women are more sensitive** to fasting-induced metabolic suppression.

**Why:**
- Female hormones are more sensitive to calorie restriction
- [Periods require adequate energy intake](/blog/pufas-womens-hormones)
- Evolution: women's bodies protect reproductive capacity

**Women on intermittent fasting often experience:**
- [Irregular or missing periods](/blog/pcos-seed-oils)
- [Worsened PMS](/blog/pufas-womens-hormones)
- [Severe fatigue](/blog/energy-crashes)
- [Intense cravings](/blog/craving-sugar)
- [Mood swings and anxiety](/blog/anxiety-pufas)

**Men tolerate fasting better** but still experience thyroid suppression long-term.

## The Stress Hormone Problem

Fasting increases cortisol and adrenaline.

**These hormones:**
- Mobilize stored glucose
- Provide energy during fasting
- Make you feel alert and focused

**This feels good initially.**

**Long-term high cortisol:**
- [Suppresses thyroid](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- Breaks down muscle
- [Disrupts sleep](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)
- [Increases anxiety](/blog/anxiety-pufas)
- Prevents fat loss

You're running on stress hormones, not metabolism.

## When Fasting Works

**Short-term (1-4 weeks):**
- Metabolically healthy people
- Weight loss kickstart
- Metabolic reset after overindulgence

**Who might benefit:**
- Metabolically healthy men
- People with high insulin/insulin resistance ([but fixing PUFAs is better](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth))
- Short duration (don't fast chronically)

**Who should avoid:**
- Women trying to conceive
- [Anyone with low thyroid](/blog/thyroid-medication)
- [Underweight or struggling to gain muscle](/blog/exercise-metabolism)
- History of disordered eating
- Chronic stress
- [Poor sleep](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)

## Better Approach: Regular Meals

**Eat 2-3 meals per day.**
- Breakfast, lunch, dinner
- [Or skip breakfast if not hungry, eat lunch and dinner](/blog/meal-planning)
- Don't force fasting if hungry

**[Each meal needs protein, fat, and carbs](/blog/meal-planning):**
- Protein: 30-50g
- Carbs: 50-100g
- Fat: 20-40g

**Support thyroid function:**
- [Adequate carbs from fruit, potatoes, rice](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- Enough calories ([don't under-eat](/blog/meal-planning))
- [Temperature should be 98°F+](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)

## What If You're Already Broken from Fasting

**Stop fasting immediately.**

**Add meals back:**
- Start with breakfast
- [Balanced meal: eggs, hash browns, fruit](/blog/meal-planning)
- Don't fear weight gain (glycogen and water, not fat)

**[Track temperature and pulse](/blog/tracking-symptoms):**
- Temperature should rise over 2-4 weeks
- Pulse should normalize to 75-85

**[Support thyroid recovery](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid):**
- Adequate carbs
- Iodine from seafood or iodized salt
- [Selenium from Brazil nuts or meat](/blog/meal-planning)

**Be patient:**
Thyroid recovery takes 4-8 weeks. [Hair growth takes 3-6 months](/blog/hair-loss-pufas). [Period returns within 3-6 months for most women](/blog/pufas-womens-hormones).

## FAQ

**Q: Can I fast once I'm metabolically healthy?**
A: Occasional fasting (24 hours, once per month) is probably fine if metabolism is strong. But daily intermittent fasting long-term suppresses thyroid for most people. Not worth it.

**Q: What about autophagy benefits?**
A: Autophagy happens during sleep and [moderate calorie restriction](/blog/meal-planning). You don't need prolonged fasting. [Exercise also stimulates autophagy](/blog/exercise-metabolism).

**Q: I feel amazing while fasting. Why should I stop?**
A: [Check your temperature and pulse](/blog/tracking-symptoms). If temperature is low and pulse is high, you're running on stress hormones, not healthy metabolism. "Feeling good" is cortisol and adrenaline, not health.

**Q: Will I gain all my weight back?**
A: Initial water weight gain (3-5 pounds) is normal. After that, weight stabilizes or continues dropping as [metabolism improves](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). Fix the root cause ([PUFAs](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge)), don't rely on restriction.

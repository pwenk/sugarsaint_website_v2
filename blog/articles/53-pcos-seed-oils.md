# Can Eliminating Seed Oils Reverse PCOS?

## TL;DR

PCOS isn't just insulin resistance. It's thyroid suppression, inflammation, and hormone disruption—all caused by PUFAs. Eliminate seed oils. Support thyroid with adequate carbs. Reduce inflammation. Cycles return. Androgen levels drop. Cysts shrink. PCOS improves or reverses in many women.

You have PCOS.

Irregular periods. Or no periods. Acne. Facial hair. Weight gain you can't lose.

Your doctor said it's genetic. Lifelong. Lose weight. Take metformin. Birth control. Spironolactone.

Nothing worked. Or it worked temporarily. Then stopped.

You're still dealing with the same symptoms. Frustrated. Exhausted.

[PCOS isn't genetic](/blog/pufas-womens-hormones). It's metabolic.

*PCOS is like trying to grow flowers in poisoned soil. You can water them (medication). Fertilize them (supplements). But until you remove the poison, nothing thrives.*

## What PCOS Actually Is

**The diagnosis:**
Polycystic ovary syndrome. Two of three criteria:
1. Irregular or absent periods
2. High androgens (testosterone, DHEA)
3. Polycystic ovaries on ultrasound

**Standard medical view:**
Insulin resistance causes PCOS. Excess insulin drives androgen production. High androgens disrupt ovulation.

**What they miss:**
[Low thyroid causes insulin resistance](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). [PUFAs suppress thyroid](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Fix thyroid. Insulin resistance improves. PCOS symptoms resolve.

## The Thyroid-PCOS Connection

**Low thyroid causes:**
- [Insulin resistance (cells can't use glucose efficiently)](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth)
- Elevated androgens (body tries to compensate)
- Anovulation (no ovulation, no progesterone)
- Irregular cycles
- Weight gain despite calorie restriction
- [Chronic fatigue](/blog/energy-crashes)

**This is PCOS.**

[Fix thyroid](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). These symptoms improve.

**How PUFAs suppress thyroid:**
- Block T4-to-T3 conversion
- Reduce thyroid hormone receptor sensitivity
- Increase reverse T3 (inactive form)
- [Damage mitochondria (where T3 acts)](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress)

[Eliminate PUFAs](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). Thyroid function improves. PCOS symptoms reduce.

## PUFAs and Androgen Excess

**High androgens in PCOS come from:**

**1. Ovarian production:**
Insulin drives ovarian androgen production. [High insulin = high testosterone](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth).

**2. Adrenal production:**
[Chronic stress (cortisol) increases DHEA and testosterone](/blog/anxiety-pufas). [PUFAs cause chronic stress response](/blog/pufas-inflammation).

**3. Poor clearance:**
Liver clears excess hormones. [Damaged liver from PUFAs = poor hormone clearance](/blog/pufas-gut-health).

**Eliminating PUFAs:**
- Reduces insulin resistance (lowers insulin-driven androgens)
- Reduces inflammation and stress (lowers adrenal androgens)
- [Improves liver function (better hormone clearance)](/blog/pufas-gut-health)

Androgen levels drop. [Acne clears](/blog/skin-health-pufas). Facial hair slows. [Hair loss stops](/blog/hair-loss-pufas).

## The Inflammation Factor

PCOS is inflammatory.

**[PUFAs cause systemic inflammation:](/blog/pufas-inflammation)**
- Oxidized PUFA metabolites trigger immune response
- Chronic inflammation disrupts hormone signaling
- Inflammatory cytokines impair ovulation

**Result:**
- Ovarian cysts form (follicles that didn't ovulate properly)
- Cycles become irregular or stop
- Fertility declines

[Eliminate PUFAs](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). Inflammation drops. Ovulation resumes. Cysts shrink over 3-6 months.

## How to Reverse PCOS

**Eliminate all seed oils.**
[Every seed oil meal suppresses your thyroid](/blog/reading-food-labels). Stop eating them. [Cook at home](/blog/cooking-basics). [Avoid restaurants](/blog/restaurant-pufa-guide).

**[Support thyroid function:](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)**
- Eat adequate carbs (150-200g daily minimum)
- Iodine from seafood or iodized salt
- Selenium from Brazil nuts or meat
- [Track temperature (goal: 98°F+)](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)

**Balance macros:**
- [Protein: 1.2-1.6g per kg body weight](/blog/meal-planning)
- [Carbs: 150-250g daily (don't go low-carb)](/blog/low-carb-thyroid)
- [Fat: 20-30% calories from butter, coconut oil, animal fats](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat)

**Manage stress:**
[High cortisol worsens PCOS](/blog/anxiety-pufas). [Prioritize sleep](/blog/body-temperature-sleep). [Reduce excessive exercise](/blog/exercise-metabolism).

**Be patient:**
- Week 4-8: [Energy improves](/blog/energy-crashes)
- Month 2-3: Periods may return (even if absent for years)
- Month 3-6: Androgen levels drop (labs confirm)
- Month 6-12: Cysts shrink on ultrasound

## What About Weight Loss

**Standard advice:** Lose weight to fix PCOS.

**Reality:** [You can't lose weight when thyroid is suppressed](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism).

**Better approach:**
Fix metabolism first. Weight loss follows naturally.

**When you eliminate PUFAs and support thyroid:**
- [Temperature rises](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- Metabolism increases
- Insulin sensitivity improves
- Weight loss becomes easier

**Don't restrict calories to lose weight.** [That further suppresses thyroid](/blog/intermittent-fasting). Eat adequate food. Fix metabolism. Weight normalizes.

## PCOS Medications and Treatments

**Metformin:**
- Reduces insulin resistance
- Can help with symptoms
- Doesn't fix root cause

**Birth control:**
- Masks irregular cycles
- Suppresses androgens temporarily
- [Doesn't fix thyroid or inflammation](/blog/pufas-womens-hormones)

**Spironolactone:**
- Blocks androgen receptors
- Reduces acne and hair growth
- Doesn't fix hormone production

**Clomid/Letrozole (fertility):**
- Induces ovulation
- Helps conception if fertility is goal
- Doesn't fix PCOS

**Our take:**
Medications treat symptoms. [Fixing metabolism treats the cause](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). You can use both. But medication alone won't reverse PCOS.

## FAQ

**Q: How long until my period returns?**
A: Most women see cycle return within 2-4 months of eliminating PUFAs and supporting thyroid. If periods absent for years, may take 4-6 months.

**Q: Will PCOS cysts disappear?**
A: Cysts are old follicles that didn't ovulate. They shrink over 3-6 months as ovulation resumes. New cysts stop forming when metabolism is optimized.

**Q: Can I get pregnant with PCOS if I fix my metabolism?**
A: [Many women conceive naturally after optimizing metabolism](/blog/pufas-womens-hormones). Improved ovulation = improved fertility. Work with your doctor if trying to conceive.

**Q: I'm on metformin. Should I stop?**
A: Don't stop medication without your doctor. But [optimize metabolism alongside medication](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Many women reduce or eliminate meds as symptoms improve. Discuss with your doctor.

# How Does Body Temperature Affect Sleep Quality?

## TL;DR

Your body temperature drops 1-2°F to fall asleep. Low daytime metabolism means low nighttime temperature drop. You can't fall asleep easily. You wake up frequently. PUFAs suppress the temperature rhythm. Fix your metabolism, and your sleep improves automatically. Warm during the day, cool at night.

You lie in bed for an hour.

Your mind won't shut off. Your body feels wired but exhausted.

You finally fall asleep. Then wake at 2 AM. Wide awake. Can't go back.

Your doctor says anxiety. Stress. Maybe sleep apnea. Offers Ambien.

Your circadian temperature rhythm is broken.

*Sleep is like a thermostat setting. If your baseline temperature is wrong, the nighttime drop never happens.*

## How Temperature Controls Sleep

Your body temperature follows a 24-hour cycle. This is your circadian rhythm.

**Healthy pattern:**
- Temperature rises in the morning (waking signal)
- Peaks in late afternoon (high energy)
- Drops in evening (sleep onset signal)
- Lowest around 4 AM (deep sleep)

The temperature DROP triggers sleep. Your brain detects cooling. It releases melatonin. Adenosine builds up. Sleep pressure increases.

If your daytime temperature is already low, the drop doesn't happen. You can't fall asleep. Or you sleep light and wake easily.

## What Low Metabolism Does to Sleep

**Low daytime temperature.** If you're running at 97.0°F during the day, you can't drop to 96.0°F at night. Your body needs that temperature differential to trigger sleep.

**Weak circadian signal.** Your brain can't tell day from night if temperature stays flat. The sleep-wake cycle gets confused.

**Stress hormone compensation.** When thyroid is low, your body makes adrenaline and cortisol to keep you going. These wake you up at night. Especially around 2-4 AM when cortisol should be lowest.

**Poor REM sleep.** Temperature regulation affects sleep architecture. Low metabolism means less deep sleep and REM. You wake unrefreshed.

This is why people with hypothyroidism often have insomnia. Their metabolism is too low to create a proper temperature rhythm.

## What You Notice

**Hard to fall asleep.** You're tired but wired. You lie in bed thinking. Takes 30-60 minutes to finally drift off.

**Frequent waking.** You wake at 2 AM or 3 AM. Sometimes multiple times. Hard to go back to sleep.

**Unrefreshing sleep.** Even 8 hours doesn't feel like enough. You wake groggy. Need coffee immediately.

**Cold extremities at night.** Your hands and feet are cold in bed. You need socks or extra blankets.

**Racing thoughts.** Your mind is active when you should be winding down. Can't shut off.

## How to Fix Sleep Through Temperature

**Eliminate PUFAs.** [Seed oils suppress thyroid function](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). This kills your temperature rhythm. Switch to saturated fats: butter, coconut oil, ghee.

**Eat enough carbohydrates.** Your body needs glucose to maintain temperature. Fruit, potatoes, white rice, honey. Low-carb diets suppress metabolism and worsen sleep.

**Track your temperature.** Measure when you wake and mid-afternoon. Watch for the pattern: should be 97.8-98.6°F during the day. [Full temperature tracking guide here](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism).

**Support circadian rhythm.** Get morning sunlight. Dim lights in evening. Cool bedroom (65-68°F). These reinforce the temperature drop signal.

**Time your carbs.** Some people sleep better with carbs at dinner. The insulin response helps trigger the temperature drop. Experiment with timing.

**Reduce stress.** High cortisol prevents temperature drop. [Track your pulse](/blog/pulse-tracking-guide) to monitor stress levels. Above 90 at rest means too much adrenaline.

Most people notice sleep improvements within 2-4 weeks of fixing metabolism. Your temperature rhythm restores. Falling asleep becomes easier. Fewer night wakings. More refreshing sleep.

## What About Sleep Supplements

**Melatonin:** Can help short-term but doesn't fix the root cause. Your body should make melatonin naturally when temperature drops. Fix metabolism instead of supplementing indefinitely.

**Magnesium:** Useful if deficient. Helps muscle relaxation. Doesn't fix temperature rhythm but can improve sleep quality. Use glycinate form before bed.

**Glycine:** Some evidence it lowers core body temperature slightly. Can help with sleep onset. 3-5g before bed.

**CBD/THC:** Sedates you but doesn't improve sleep quality. Can suppress REM sleep. Not a solution.

The best "supplement" is fixing your metabolic rate. Everything else is a band-aid.

## Track Both Temperature and Sleep

Keep a simple log:

```
Date | AM Temp | PM Temp | Sleep Quality | Notes
10/23 | 97.2 | 97.8 | Poor, woke 3x | Cold hands all night
10/24 | 97.5 | 98.1 | Better, woke 1x | Warmer today
10/25 | 97.8 | 98.4 | Good, slept through | Felt warm all day
```

Look for the correlation. As your daytime temperature climbs toward 98°F, sleep usually improves.

This takes weeks, not days. Your temperature rhythm needs time to restore as cell membranes rebuild with saturated fats instead of PUFAs.

## FAQ

**Q: I'm warm during the day but still can't sleep. Why?**
A: Check your pulse. If it's above 90 at rest, you're running on stress hormones (adrenaline), not metabolism. Address stress and recovery. High pulse keeps you wired at night.

**Q: Should I take cold showers to trigger the temperature drop?**
A: Cold exposure can help some people but doesn't fix low metabolism. If your baseline temperature is already low, adding cold stress can worsen things. Fix metabolism first.

**Q: How long until sleep improves after eliminating PUFAs?**
A: Most people notice changes within 2-4 weeks. Full improvement takes 2-3 months as your circadian temperature rhythm fully restores.

**Q: What if I have diagnosed sleep apnea?**
A: Treat the apnea (CPAP, oral appliance, surgery if needed). But many people find apnea improves as they lose weight and reduce inflammation through PUFA elimination. Work with your sleep specialist.

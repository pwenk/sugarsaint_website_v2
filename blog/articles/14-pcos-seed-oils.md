# How Do Seed Oils Affect PCOS?

## TL;DR

PCOS involves insulin resistance, high androgens, and inflammation—all worsened by PUFAs. Seed oils suppress thyroid function, increase estrogen, and promote insulin resistance. Eliminating them improves insulin sensitivity, lowers testosterone, and regulates cycles within 3-6 months for many women.

Your periods disappeared.

Or they're irregular. 40 days. 60 days. Sometimes three months.

Acne along your jawline. Hair thinning on your head. Growing where it shouldn't.

Your doctor says PCOS. Prescribes birth control. Metformin. Maybe spironolactone.

The symptoms improve slightly. But they never fully resolve.

The seed oils in your diet are driving the hormonal chaos.

*PCOS is a three-legged stool: insulin resistance, high androgens, inflammation. PUFAs kick all three legs.*

## What PCOS Actually Is

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome involves three main problems:

**Insulin resistance.** Your cells don't respond to insulin well. Glucose can't enter easily. Your pancreas makes more insulin to compensate. High insulin triggers your ovaries to make testosterone.

**High androgens.** Testosterone and DHEA-S rise. This causes acne, hair growth (hirsutism), hair loss (male pattern), and irregular ovulation.

**Chronic inflammation.** Your immune system is overactive. This worsens insulin resistance and disrupts ovulation.

Conventional treatment targets symptoms. Birth control suppresses ovulation. Metformin improves insulin sensitivity. Spironolactone blocks androgens.

But none of these fix the root cause. PUFAs drive all three problems.

## How PUFAs Worsen PCOS

**They cause insulin resistance.** PUFA-rich cell membranes don't respond to insulin properly. [This makes your cells resistant to glucose uptake](/blog/pufas-vs-sugar-obesity). High insulin follows. High insulin triggers androgen production.

**They suppress thyroid function.** Low thyroid worsens insulin resistance. It also raises prolactin and disrupts ovulation. [Most women with PCOS have subclinical hypothyroidism](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

**They increase inflammation.** [PUFAs oxidize and create inflammatory compounds](/blog/pufas-inflammation). Chronic inflammation disrupts the HPO axis (hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary). Your ovulation signals get scrambled.

**They raise estrogen.** PUFAs increase aromatase activity. This converts testosterone to estrogen. But in PCOS, you already have hormonal imbalance. More estrogen worsens the ratio.

## What You Notice

**Irregular or missing periods.** You might go 40, 60, or 90+ days without a period. Or you bleed unpredictably.

**Acne.** Especially along the jawline, chin, and chest. Hormonal acne from high androgens.

**Hirsutism.** Dark hair growth on face, chest, or abdomen where women don't typically grow hair.

**Hair thinning.** Male-pattern hair loss on the crown or temples.

**Weight gain.** Especially around the abdomen. Insulin resistance makes fat loss nearly impossible.

**Difficulty getting pregnant.** Irregular ovulation means fewer chances to conceive.

**Dark skin patches.** Acanthosis nigricans on neck, armpits, or groin. Sign of severe insulin resistance.

## What You Do

**Eliminate seed oils completely.** No canola, soybean, sunflower, safflower, or corn oil. These drive insulin resistance and inflammation.

**Cook with saturated fats.** Butter, coconut oil, ghee. These improve insulin sensitivity and don't promote inflammation.

**Eat enough carbohydrates.** Don't go low-carb. Your thyroid needs glucose to function. Low-carb worsens PCOS long-term. Eat fruit, potatoes, white rice, honey. [Carbs support thyroid function](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

**Prioritize protein.** Meat, eggs, dairy (if tolerated). Protein stabilizes blood sugar and supports hormone production.

**Track your cycle.** Mark the first day of each period. Note cycle length. Watch for improvements over 3-6 months.

**Monitor symptoms.** Acne. Hair growth. Hair loss. Energy. Weight. These improve as insulin sensitivity returns.

Most women with PCOS see improvements within 3-6 months of eliminating seed oils:
- Periods return or become more regular
- Acne clears significantly
- Hirsutism slows (existing hair won't disappear, but new growth reduces)
- Energy improves
- Weight loss becomes possible
- Insulin sensitivity increases

Labs improve too. Fasting insulin drops. Testosterone normalizes. A1c comes down.

## FAQ

**Q: Will eliminating seed oils cure my PCOS?**
A: PCOS doesn't "cure." But removing PUFAs addresses root causes: insulin resistance, inflammation, and thyroid suppression. Many women restore regular cycles and fertility. Work with your doctor to monitor progress.

**Q: Should I stay on metformin?**
A: Discuss with your doctor. Some women no longer need it as insulin sensitivity improves. Others stay on it. Don't stop medication without medical supervision.

**Q: What about inositol supplements?**
A: Myo-inositol and d-chiro-inositol can help PCOS. They improve insulin signaling. But they work better when you've eliminated PUFAs first. Fix the diet, then add supplements if needed.

**Q: How long until my periods return?**
A: Varies. Some women see return in 6-8 weeks. Others take 3-6 months. If you've been on birth control, it can take longer. Be patient. Track temperature and symptoms to monitor metabolic recovery.

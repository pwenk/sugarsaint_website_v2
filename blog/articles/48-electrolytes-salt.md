# Do You Need Salt and Electrolytes for Metabolism?

## TL;DR

Yes. Salt supports thyroid, adrenal function, and circulation. Low salt worsens fatigue, brain fog, and low blood pressure. Salt to taste. Most people need more, not less. Potassium from food (fruit, potatoes). Magnesium from food or supplements if deficient. Don't fear salt.

You've been told salt is bad.

Causes high blood pressure. Heart disease. Stroke.

You've been restricting salt for years.

Now you're dizzy when you stand. Fatigued. [Can't think clearly](/blog/brain-fog-pufas). [Craving salt constantly](/blog/craving-sugar).

Your body needs salt. You've been starving it.

*Salt is like oil in an engine. Too little, everything grinds to a halt. The right amount, everything runs smooth.*

## What Salt Does

**Maintains blood volume:**
Your blood is salty. Low salt = low blood volume = poor circulation.

**Supports adrenal function:**
Adrenals need sodium to make aldosterone (regulates fluid balance).

**Enables nerve signaling:**
Sodium and potassium create electrical gradients. Nerves fire. Muscles contract.

**Supports thyroid:**
[Thyroid hormone production requires adequate salt](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

**Without enough salt:**
- Low blood pressure
- Dizziness (especially when standing)
- Fatigue
- [Brain fog](/blog/brain-fog-pufas)
- [Muscle cramps](/blog/joint-pain-pufas)
- Increased stress hormones (cortisol, adrenaline)

## The Salt-Blood Pressure Myth

**Standard advice:** Low salt prevents high blood pressure.

**Reality:** For most people, salt intake doesn't significantly affect blood pressure.

**Who needs to restrict salt:**
- Salt-sensitive individuals (minority)
- Advanced kidney disease

**Everyone else:**
Salt to taste. Your body regulates it.

**What actually causes high blood pressure:**
- [Insulin resistance](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth)
- [Chronic inflammation from PUFAs](/blog/pufas-inflammation)
- [Chronic stress](/blog/anxiety-pufas)
- [Poor sleep](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)
- Sedentary lifestyle

[Fix these](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). Blood pressure normalizes.

## How Much Salt

**Listen to your body.**

If you crave salt, you need salt. Salt your food until it tastes good.

**General needs:**
- 3-6g sodium per day (7.5-15g salt)
- More if you sweat heavily
- More if you eat low-carb initially (flush more sodium)

**Signs you need more salt:**
- Dizziness when standing
- Fatigue
- [Muscle cramps](/blog/exercise-metabolism)
- Intense salt cravings
- Low blood pressure (below 100/60)

**Signs you're getting enough:**
- Stable energy
- No dizziness
- No cravings
- Normal blood pressure

## What Type of Salt

**Any salt works.**

**Options:**
- Sea salt (natural minerals)
- Himalayan pink salt (trace minerals)
- Regular iodized salt (cheap, provides iodine)

**Iodine matters:**
[Thyroid needs iodine](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). If you don't eat seafood regularly, use iodized salt.

**Don't overthink this.** Salt is salt.

## Potassium

Works with sodium. Balance matters.

**Food sources:**
- Potatoes (800mg per medium potato)
- Bananas (400mg)
- Avocados (500mg)
- Oranges (250mg)
- Meat (300-500mg per serving)

**Needs:**
- 3,000-4,000mg per day

**From food:**
- [Potatoes, fruit, meat](/blog/meal-planning) easily provide this

**Don't supplement high-dose potassium** without doctor supervision. Can be dangerous.

## Magnesium

Many people are deficient.

**Functions:**
- Muscle relaxation
- Energy production
- [Bone health](/blog/calcium-vitamin-d)
- Nervous system function

**Food sources:**
- Dark chocolate (200mg per ounce)
- Nuts (if tolerated)
- Leafy greens (50-100mg per serving)
- Meat (20-50mg per serving)

**Needs:**
- 300-400mg per day

**Hard to get enough from food** unless eating a lot of nuts or dark chocolate.

**Supplement:**
- Magnesium glycinate (best absorption, doesn't cause diarrhea)
- 300-400mg before bed (helps sleep)

## Electrolytes During Exercise

[If you exercise intensely or sweat heavily](/blog/exercise-metabolism), you lose electrolytes.

**Replace:**
- Salt food well
- [Drink milk (contains sodium, potassium, calcium)](/blog/meal-planning)
- Eat fruit (potassium)
- Add pinch of salt to water if exercising over 60 minutes

**Don't need:**
- Commercial electrolyte drinks (usually contain sugar and seed oils)
- Expensive electrolyte powders

[Real food provides electrolytes](/blog/meal-planning).

## FAQ

**Q: Will eating more salt make me bloated?**
A: Initially, you might retain water for 2-3 days. This stabilizes. Long-term, adequate salt reduces bloating (improves circulation and hormone balance).

**Q: I have high blood pressure. Should I still eat salt?**
A: Work with your doctor. But [fixing insulin resistance and inflammation](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge) often normalizes blood pressure. Many people reduce blood pressure medication after metabolic optimization despite eating more salt.

**Q: What about electrolyte supplements (LMNT, Redmond Re-Lyte)?**
A: Fine if convenient. But not necessary. [Salting your food](/blog/meal-planning) and [eating potassium-rich foods](/blog/meal-planning) is cheaper and equally effective.

**Q: Can you eat too much salt?**
A: Rare with whole food diet. Your body excretes excess. Extreme intake (20+ grams per day) can be problematic. But salting food to taste won't cause this.

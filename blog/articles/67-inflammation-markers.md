# What Lab Tests Show Inflammation from PUFAs?

## TL;DR

High-sensitivity CRP measures systemic inflammation. Goal: under 1.0 mg/L. PUFAs raise CRP through oxidative stress. ESR, white blood cells, and cytokines also show inflammation. Eliminate seed oils. CRP drops within 8-12 weeks. Test every 3-6 months. Falling CRP = healing metabolism.

You feel inflamed.

[Joints ache](/blog/joint-pain-pufas). [Skin breaks out](/blog/skin-health-pufas). [Brain foggy](/blog/brain-fog-pufas). [Gut bloated](/blog/pufas-gut-health). [Always tired](/blog/energy-crashes).

Your doctor runs bloodwork. "Everything looks normal."

But you don't feel normal. You feel inflamed.

Standard labs miss chronic inflammation. You need specific markers.

*Inflammation is like smoke from a fire. You can feel it. Smell it. But standard tests measure the temperature in the next room. Not useful.*

## The Best Inflammation Marker: hsCRP

**High-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP)**

**What it measures:**
Acute-phase protein produced by liver in response to inflammation. Most sensitive marker for systemic inflammation.

**Interpretation:**
- **Under 1.0 mg/L:** Low inflammation (optimal)
- **1.0-3.0 mg/L:** Moderate inflammation (concerning)
- **Above 3.0 mg/L:** High inflammation (requires intervention)
- **Above 10 mg/L:** Severe inflammation (often acute illness)

**What causes high CRP:**
- [Oxidized PUFAs](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress)
- [Chronic infections](/blog/pufas-gut-health)
- [Obesity (fat tissue releases inflammatory cytokines)](/blog/pufas-inflammation)
- [Autoimmune conditions](/blog/pufas-inflammation)
- [Insulin resistance](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth)
- [Poor sleep](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)
- [Chronic stress](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism)

**[Eliminate PUFAs](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge).** CRP usually drops within 8-12 weeks.

## Other Inflammation Markers

### **ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate)**

**What it measures:**
How fast red blood cells settle in test tube. Faster settling = more inflammation.

**Normal ranges:**
- Men: under 15 mm/hr
- Women: under 20 mm/hr

**Less specific than CRP.** But helpful for tracking chronic inflammatory conditions.

### **White Blood Cell Count (WBC)**

**What it measures:**
Number of white blood cells. Elevated = immune system activation.

**Normal range:**
4,000-11,000 cells/μL

**High WBC can indicate:**
- Infection
- Chronic inflammation
- [Leaky gut (endotoxin exposure)](/blog/pufas-gut-health)
- Stress response

**If chronically elevated without infection:**
[Check for gut issues](/blog/pufas-gut-health). [Eliminate seed oils](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge).

### **Ferritin**

**What it measures:**
Iron storage protein. But also an acute-phase reactant (rises with inflammation).

**Normal range:**
- Men: 30-300 ng/mL
- Women: 15-200 ng/mL

**High ferritin with normal iron:**
Indicates inflammation, not iron overload. [Common with PUFA consumption](/blog/pufas-inflammation).

**Low ferritin:**
True iron deficiency. [Needs supplementation](/blog/energy-crashes).

### **Fibrinogen**

**What it measures:**
Clotting protein that increases with inflammation.

**Normal range:**
200-400 mg/dL

**High fibrinogen:**
[Increased cardiovascular risk](/blog/cholesterol-myth). [Inflammation-driven](/blog/pufas-inflammation).

### **Platelets**

**What they do:**
Blood clotting.

**Normal range:**
150,000-400,000/μL

**High platelets (above 400,000):**
Can indicate inflammation or [iron deficiency](/blog/energy-crashes).

## Advanced Inflammatory Markers

**These aren't routine. Order if hsCRP is elevated and cause unclear.**

### **Cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha)**

**What they measure:**
Inflammatory signaling molecules.

**[High levels indicate:](/blog/pufas-inflammation)**
- Neuroinflammation
- [Gut inflammation](/blog/pufas-gut-health)
- [Autoimmune activation](/blog/pufas-inflammation)

**Specialty labs only.**

### **Omega-6:Omega-3 Ratio**

**What it measures:**
Ratio of inflammatory (omega-6) to anti-inflammatory (omega-3) fatty acids in blood.

**Ideal ratio:**
Under 4:1 (lower is better)

**Modern diet average:**
15:1 to 20:1 (very inflammatory)

**[Eliminate seed oils (omega-6 source)](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge).** Ratio improves over 6-12 months.

### **Oxidized LDL**

**What it measures:**
[LDL cholesterol particles that have been oxidized by free radicals](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress).

**[Oxidized LDL drives atherosclerosis](/blog/cholesterol-myth).** Standard cholesterol test doesn't measure this.

**Specialty lab test.** Useful if concerned about [heart disease risk](/blog/cholesterol-myth).

## How to Lower Inflammation Markers

**[Eliminate all seed oils:](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge)**
Primary intervention. [Stop eating vegetable oils, canola, soybean, sunflower, etc](/blog/reading-food-labels).

**[Eat anti-inflammatory foods:](/blog/meal-planning)**
- [Fatty fish (salmon, sardines) for omega-3](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat)
- [Butter and coconut oil (stable, don't oxidize)](/blog/cooking-basics)
- [Fruits and vegetables (antioxidants)](/blog/meal-planning)
- [Bone broth (glycine)](/blog/pufas-gut-health)

**[Support thyroid:](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)**
[Low thyroid increases inflammation](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).
- Adequate carbs
- Iodine and selenium
- [Track temperature](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)

**[Improve sleep:](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)**
Poor sleep raises CRP. [Fix sleep for better inflammation control](/blog/body-temperature-sleep).

**[Reduce stress:](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism)**
[Chronic cortisol increases inflammation](/blog/anxiety-pufas). Meditate. Walk. Lower training volume.

**[Fix gut health:](/blog/pufas-gut-health)**
[Leaky gut = chronic inflammation](/blog/pufas-gut-health). [Heal gut lining with bone broth](/blog/pufas-gut-health), [simple foods](/blog/meal-planning).

**Timeline:**
- Week 4-8: [Energy and symptoms improve](/blog/energy-crashes)
- Month 2-3: CRP begins dropping
- Month 3-6: CRP reaches optimal (under 1.0)
- Month 6-12: All inflammation markers normalize

## Testing Schedule

**Baseline (before starting):**
- hsCRP
- Complete blood count (CBC)
- Comprehensive metabolic panel
- [Thyroid panel](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation)
- [Lipid panel](/blog/cholesterol-myth)

**Follow-up (every 3-6 months):**
- hsCRP
- [Thyroid panel](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation)
- [Fasting insulin](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth)

**Compare results.**  Track improvements. Falling CRP = healing.

## When CRP Doesn't Drop

**If CRP stays elevated after 12 weeks:**

**Check for:**
- [Hidden seed oils in diet](/blog/reading-food-labels)
- [Undereating (suppresses thyroid, increases inflammation)](/blog/intermittent-fasting)
- [Overtraining](/blog/exercise-metabolism)
- [Chronic infections (dental, gut, sinus)](/blog/pufas-gut-health)
- [Autoimmune conditions (require medical management)](/blog/pufas-inflammation)
- [Sleep apnea](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)
- [Chronic stress](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism)

**Work with doctor** to identify and address specific causes.

## FAQ

**Q: My CRP is 5.2. How long to normalize?**
A: [Eliminate all seed oils](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). Most people see CRP drop to under 3.0 within 8-12 weeks, under 1.0 within 6 months. [Track symptoms alongside labs](/blog/tracking-symptoms).

**Q: Can I test CRP at home?**
A: No. Requires blood draw and lab analysis. Request from doctor or order through online lab (LabCorp, Quest).

**Q: What if my CRP is under 1.0 but I still feel bad?**
A: CRP measures systemic inflammation. [You can have localized inflammation (gut, joints) without high CRP](/blog/pufas-gut-health). [Track symptoms](/blog/tracking-symptoms) and [other markers](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation).

**Q: My doctor says CRP under 3.0 is fine.**
A: Standard reference is under 3.0. Optimal is under 1.0. [Lower inflammation = better health outcomes](/blog/pufas-inflammation). Aim for optimal, not just "normal."

# Why Is Your Skin Breaking Out? PUFAs and Acne

## TL;DR

Acne is inflammatory. PUFAs cause inflammation and oxidize in sebaceous glands, creating inflamed pores. High insulin from PUFA-induced insulin resistance increases sebum production and keratinization. Eliminate seed oils, support thyroid, eat saturated fats. Skin clears within 6-12 weeks for most people.

Your skin won't clear.

You tried everything. Benzoyl peroxide. Salicylic acid. Prescription retinoids. Antibiotics. Even Accutane.

Nothing works long-term. Or it works temporarily, then the acne returns.

You're 25. Or 35. Or 45. Adult acne that never ends.

Your skin isn't the problem. Your metabolism is.

*Acne is like smoke from a fire. You can fan the smoke away. Or you can put out the fire. PUFAs are the fire.*

## What Causes Acne

Acne is inflammation in sebaceous glands (oil-producing glands in skin).

**The process:**
1. Sebaceous gland produces sebum (oil)
2. Dead skin cells clog the pore
3. Bacteria (C. acnes) multiply in clogged pore
4. Immune system responds
5. Inflammation creates red, painful pimples

**Standard explanation:** "Hormones cause excess oil. Bacteria cause inflammation."

**Missing piece:** Why are your hormones dysregulated? Why is inflammation so severe?

[PUFAs](/blog/pufas-inflammation).

## How PUFAs Cause Acne

**They oxidize in sebum.**
Sebum contains fats from your diet. [When you eat PUFAs, they end up in sebum](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress). PUFAs oxidize easily. [Oxidized fats trigger inflammation](/blog/pufas-inflammation).

**They cause insulin resistance.**
[High insulin increases sebum production](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth). It also increases keratinization (skin cells stick together, clogging pores). [PUFAs cause insulin resistance](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat).

**They raise androgens.**
[High insulin increases androgen production](/blog/pcos-seed-oils). [Androgens stimulate sebaceous glands](/blog/testosterone-pufas). More oil = more clogged pores.

**They suppress thyroid.**
[Low thyroid worsens acne](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Skin turnover slows. Pores clog more easily. Healing is slower.

**They damage gut lining.**
[Leaky gut causes systemic inflammation](/blog/pufas-gut-health). This worsens skin inflammation. Gut-skin axis is real.

## Types of Acne and What They Mean

**Comedonal (blackheads/whiteheads):**
Clogged pores without inflammation. Usually insulin-driven. High sebum production, slow skin turnover.

**Inflammatory (red, painful pimples):**
Oxidized sebum triggering immune response. PUFA-heavy sebum oxidizes and creates intense inflammation.

**Cystic (deep, painful nodules):**
Severe inflammation deep in skin. Often [hormonal (PCOS, high androgens)](/blog/pcos-seed-oils) plus oxidative stress from PUFAs.

**Jawline/chin acne (women):**
[Hormonal. Usually PCOS or estrogen dominance](/blog/pufas-womens-hormones). Worsened by PUFAs suppressing thyroid and raising androgens.

**Back and chest acne:**
[High androgens, often in men with low testosterone](/blog/testosterone-pufas) (body compensates by increasing DHT). Or athletes using protein powders with soy (phytoestrogens).

## What You Notice

**Acne that won't respond to topicals.**
You use every cream. Nothing works. Because the problem isn't on your skin surface. It's inside.

**Acne that gets worse with certain foods.**
Fried food (seed oils). Dairy (if processed with vegetable oils). Sugar alone usually doesn't cause acne unless combined with PUFAs.

**Acne tied to menstrual cycle (women).**
Worse before period. [Hormones fluctuate, insulin sensitivity changes](/blog/pufas-womens-hormones). PUFAs amplify the hormonal swings.

**Acne that improves on vacation.**
You eat less restaurant food. Less seed oils. Inflammation drops. Skin clears. Then returns when you go home.

**Oily skin that never improves.**
No matter what you do, your face is shiny by noon. High insulin from PUFA-induced insulin resistance drives constant sebum production.

## How to Clear Your Skin

**Eliminate seed oils completely.**
[Stop eating vegetable oil, canola, soybean, sunflower, safflower, corn oil](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). This is the foundation. Nothing else works without this.

**Eat saturated fats.**
Butter, coconut oil, ghee. These don't oxidize. They create stable, non-inflammatory sebum. [Your skin oil becomes less inflammatory](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat).

**[Support thyroid function.](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)**
Adequate carbs (fruit, potatoes, rice). Iodine from seafood or iodized salt. [Track your temperature](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)—should climb toward 98°F.

**[Fix insulin resistance.](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth)**
Eliminate PUFAs (primary cause). Eat balanced meals with protein, fat, and carbs. [Don't skip meals](/blog/meal-planning).

**[Heal your gut.](/blog/pufas-gut-health)**
Damaged gut lining worsens systemic inflammation. Eat easily digestible foods. Bone broth, gelatin, cooked vegetables, meat, fruit.

**Get adequate protein.**
Skin rebuilds constantly. You need amino acids. 0.8-1g per pound of body weight.

**Reduce dairy if needed.**
Some people's acne improves eliminating dairy (especially conventional milk with added hormones or processed with vegetable oils). Try 30 days without. See if skin improves.

**Manage stress.**
[High cortisol worsens acne](/blog/anxiety-pufas). [Sleep is critical](/blog/body-temperature-sleep). [Don't overtrain](/blog/exercise-metabolism).

Most people see skin improvements:
- Week 2-4: Less new breakouts
- Week 6-8: Existing acne healing faster
- Week 12-16: Significant clearing
- Month 6-12: Clear skin, occasional minor breakout

## Topicals That Help (Once Diet Is Fixed)

**Gentle cleanser:**
Don't strip your skin. Overwashing makes it worse (triggers more oil production). Wash 1-2x daily with gentle cleanser.

**Retinoids (tretinoin, adapalene):**
Increase skin turnover. Unclog pores. Work better when sebum isn't oxidized from PUFAs. Get prescription-strength if possible.

**Niacinamide:**
B vitamin that reduces inflammation and sebum production. Topical serums work well. Or eat meat (high in niacin).

**Azelaic acid:**
Anti-inflammatory and antibacterial. Gentle. Works well for inflammatory acne.

**Don't use:**
Harsh scrubs (damage skin barrier). Benzoyl peroxide long-term (creates oxidative stress). Alcohol-based toners (strip skin).

**Remember:** Topicals help manage symptoms. Diet fixes the cause.

## What About Accutane

Accutane (isotretinoin) is powerful. It works by:
- Shrinking sebaceous glands
- Reducing sebum production dramatically
- Reducing inflammation

**It works.** For severe cystic acne, it can be life-changing.

**Downsides:**
- Severe side effects (dry skin, joint pain, mood changes, birth defects)
- Doesn't fix metabolic root cause
- Acne often returns after stopping (30-40% of people)
- Requires monitoring by dermatologist

**Our take:**
Try diet first. [Eliminate PUFAs, support thyroid, fix insulin resistance](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). Give it 6 months. If acne persists and is severe (cystic, scarring), consider Accutane. But fix diet during and after treatment to prevent recurrence.

Many people who failed topical treatments succeed with diet. Some still need Accutane. But fewer than you'd think.

## What About Hormonal Acne

"Hormonal acne" usually means:
- [PCOS in women](/blog/pcos-seed-oils)
- [Low testosterone with high DHT in men](/blog/testosterone-pufas)
- [Perimenopause or menopause](/blog/menopause-pufas)

**All of these are metabolic.**

Fix the metabolism, hormones balance, acne improves.

**For women with PCOS:**
[Eliminate PUFAs, support thyroid, fix insulin resistance](/blog/pcos-seed-oils). Acne improves as androgens normalize.

**For men:**
[Optimize testosterone naturally](/blog/testosterone-pufas). High-quality testosterone means less conversion to problematic DHT.

**For perimenopausal women:**
[Support thyroid aggressively](/blog/menopause-pufas). Estrogen decline worsens acne if thyroid is already low.

Birth control pills "work" for hormonal acne by suppressing your natural hormones. They don't fix the root cause. When you stop, acne returns worse.

## FAQ

**Q: I eliminated seed oils but my skin isn't clearing. What's wrong?**
A: How long has it been? Skin takes 3-6 months to fully clear. [Are you eating enough carbs to support thyroid](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)? [Is your gut healed](/blog/pufas-gut-health)? Are you still eating dairy? Track your diet for hidden PUFAs.

**Q: Can I use makeup if I'm trying to clear my skin?**
A: Yes, but check ingredients. Many makeup products contain seed oils. Look for mineral-based makeup or products with jojoba, coconut, or nothing (powder-based).

**Q: Does chocolate cause acne?**
A: Not dark chocolate (high-quality, low sugar). Milk chocolate with vegetable oils might. [Sugar alone doesn't cause acne unless you're insulin resistant](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth).

**Q: Will my acne scars fade?**
A: Surface scars fade with skin turnover (faster with retinoids). Deep scars need treatments (microneedling, lasers). But stop creating new scars by fixing the root cause of acne first.

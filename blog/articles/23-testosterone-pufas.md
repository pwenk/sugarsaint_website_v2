# How Do PUFAs Lower Testosterone in Men?

## TL;DR

PUFAs suppress thyroid function, which lowers LH signaling to testes. Less LH means less testosterone production. PUFAs also increase aromatase, converting testosterone to estrogen. You end up with low T, high estrogen, and all the symptoms: low libido, fat gain, fatigue, brain fog. Eliminate seed oils, support thyroid, testosterone climbs naturally.

Your testosterone is in the gutter.

You're 35. Or 45. Should be in your prime.

But your libido disappeared. You're soft around the middle. Tired all the time. Can't focus.

Your doctor ran labs. Total testosterone: 350 ng/dL. "Normal range is 300-1000," she says. "You're fine."

You're not fine. You're on the low end of "normal." That's the testosterone of a 70-year-old.

The seed oils you eat every day are castrating you chemically.

*Testosterone is like a fire. PUFAs are a wet blanket. You can't burn hot when you're soaking wet.*

## How Testosterone Production Works

Your brain (hypothalamus and pituitary) signals your testes.

**Normal cascade:**
1. Hypothalamus releases GnRH
2. Pituitary releases LH (luteinizing hormone)
3. LH tells testes to make testosterone
4. Testes convert cholesterol → pregnenolone → testosterone
5. Some testosterone converts to DHT (more potent)
6. Some converts to estrogen (via aromatase enzyme)

You need proper balance. Enough testosterone. Not too much estrogen. Good DHT levels.

[PUFAs disrupt this entire system](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

## What PUFAs Do to Testosterone

**They suppress thyroid function.** Low thyroid means weak signaling from brain to testes. Your pituitary doesn't send strong LH signals. Your testes don't get the message to make testosterone.

**They increase aromatase activity.** Aromatase converts testosterone to estrogen. More aromatase means less testosterone, more estrogen. You end up with female-pattern fat storage, gynecomastia (man boobs), low libido.

**They damage testicular cells.** [PUFAs oxidize and create inflammatory compounds](/blog/pufas-inflammation). Leydig cells (testosterone producers) in testes are sensitive to oxidative stress. Damage them and production drops.

**They disrupt cell membranes.** Testosterone receptors sit in cell membranes. PUFA-loaded membranes don't respond to hormones properly. Even if you make testosterone, your cells can't use it effectively.

The research backs this up:
- Men who eat more PUFAs have lower testosterone
- Animals fed seed oils show testicular damage and reduced T
- Replacing PUFAs with saturated fats increases testosterone production

## What Low Testosterone Looks Like

**Physical signs:**
- Increased body fat, especially abdominal and chest
- Decreased muscle mass despite training
- Low energy and chronic fatigue
- Reduced strength

**Sexual signs:**
- Low or absent libido
- Erectile dysfunction
- Reduced morning erections (should wake with erection daily)
- [Poor sperm quality](/blog/sperm-quality-pufas)

**Mental signs:**
- Brain fog and poor concentration
- Depression or low mood
- Irritability
- Lack of motivation or drive

**Metabolic signs:**
- [Cold body temperature](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- [Weak pulse](/blog/pulse-tracking-guide)
- Poor sleep quality
- Increased hunger and cravings

## What Your Labs Should Show

**Total Testosterone:**
- Low: Below 500 ng/dL (despite "normal range" being 300+)
- Optimal: 700-1000 ng/dL
- High: Above 1100 ng/dL

**Free Testosterone:**
- More important than total (this is bioavailable testosterone)
- Low: Bottom third of range
- Optimal: Top third of range

**Estradiol (E2):**
- Should be 20-30 pg/mL for men
- Above 40 pg/mL indicates excess aromatase activity
- Below 15 pg/mL can cause joint pain and low libido too

**SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin):**
- High SHBG binds testosterone, making it unavailable
- Low SHBG seen with insulin resistance
- Optimal: Middle of range

**LH and FSH:**
- If testosterone is low but LH is normal or low: problem is in brain-testicular signaling (usually thyroid-related)
- If LH is high but testosterone is low: testicular failure (less common)

Most men with PUFA-suppressed testosterone have low-normal LH with low testosterone. The signaling is weak.

## How to Increase Testosterone Naturally

**Eliminate seed oils completely.** [Stop eating PUFAs immediately](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). Canola, soybean, sunflower, safflower, corn oil. All of them.

**Cook with saturated fats.** Butter, coconut oil, ghee, beef tallow. Saturated fats support hormone production and don't increase aromatase.

**Eat adequate cholesterol.** Testosterone is made from cholesterol. Eat eggs, meat, full-fat dairy. Don't fear dietary cholesterol.

**Support thyroid function.** [Eat enough carbohydrates](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Fruit, potatoes, rice, honey. Your thyroid needs glucose. Low-carb suppresses thyroid and testosterone.

**Get enough protein.** 0.8-1g per pound of body weight. Amino acids support hormone synthesis.

**Optimize sleep.** Testosterone is made during deep sleep. [Fix your sleep by optimizing metabolism](/blog/body-temperature-sleep). Get 7-8 hours consistently.

**[Strength train, don't overtrain.](/blog/exercise-metabolism)** Heavy compound lifts 2-4x per week. Long rest periods. Stop before total fatigue. Avoid excessive cardio.

**Manage stress.** High cortisol suppresses testosterone. Chronic stress kills T production.

**Get sunlight.** Vitamin D supports testosterone production. 15-30 minutes of sun exposure daily, or supplement D3.

Most men see testosterone increase 100-300 ng/dL within 3-6 months of eliminating PUFAs and optimizing metabolism. Some see even more dramatic improvements.

## What About TRT (Testosterone Replacement Therapy)

TRT can be helpful. But it doesn't fix the root cause.

If you go on TRT while still eating PUFAs:
- Your body will aromatize testosterone to estrogen (need AI - aromatase inhibitor)
- Your natural production shuts down
- You're dependent on injections forever
- Your fertility drops (testes shrink from lack of LH stimulation)

**Better approach:**
1. Eliminate PUFAs and optimize metabolism first
2. Retest after 6 months
3. If testosterone is still low despite optimization, then consider TRT

Many men find they don't need TRT once metabolism is fixed. But some do, especially older men or those with testicular damage. Work with a knowledgeable doctor.

If you're already on TRT, you can still benefit from PUFA elimination. You'll need less testosterone, feel better, and have better estrogen management.

## What Changes When T Increases

**Within 2-4 weeks:**
- Libido starts returning
- Morning erections return
- Energy improves
- Mood lifts

**Within 2-3 months:**
- Easier to build muscle
- Fat loss becomes possible (especially around midsection)
- Strength increases
- Mental clarity improves
- Confidence returns

**Within 6-12 months:**
- Body composition significantly changes
- [Sperm quality improves](/blog/sperm-quality-pufas) (if fertility is a concern)
- Metabolic health optimizes
- You feel like yourself again

Labs should show rising testosterone, decreasing estradiol, improved T:E ratio.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I take supplements to boost testosterone?**
A: Most "T-boosting" supplements are overhyped. Zinc and vitamin D help if you're deficient. Boron may slightly increase free T. But none of these work if you're still eating PUFAs. Fix diet first. Then consider targeted supplementation if needed.

**Q: Will eliminating PUFAs cure my erectile dysfunction?**
A: ED has multiple causes (vascular, neurological, psychological). But many men find ED improves or resolves when testosterone increases and metabolic health improves. If ED persists after metabolic optimization, investigate other factors (blood flow, medications, relationship issues).

**Q: I'm on finasteride for hair loss. Does this affect testosterone?**
A: Finasteride blocks conversion of testosterone to DHT. This can cause sexual side effects in some men. DHT is important for libido and sexual function. If you're experiencing side effects, discuss alternatives with your doctor. Optimizing metabolism may help hair loss too (better circulation, less inflammation).

**Q: How often should I test testosterone?**
A: Baseline before making changes. Retest after 3 months of PUFA elimination. Then every 6-12 months once optimized. Test in the morning (T is highest then). Get comprehensive panel: Total T, Free T, Estradiol, SHBG, LH, FSH.

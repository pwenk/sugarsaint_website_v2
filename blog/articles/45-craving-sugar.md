# Why Can't You Stop Craving Sugar?

## TL;DR

Sugar cravings are metabolic, not psychological. Low blood sugar from insulin resistance triggers cravings. Low thyroid increases need for quick energy. Eliminate PUFAs, stabilize blood sugar, support thyroid. Cravings disappear within 2-4 weeks.

You can't stop eating sugar.

Cookies after lunch. Candy at 3 PM. Ice cream after dinner.

You tell yourself you'll stop. Tomorrow you'll have willpower.

Tomorrow comes. You eat sugar again.

It's not willpower. [Your metabolism is broken](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

*Sugar cravings are like thirst. You can use willpower to ignore thirst. But you'll still be dehydrated. Fix the dehydration, thirst stops.*

## What Causes Sugar Cravings

**Your body needs fuel.** Glucose is fast fuel.

**When you crave sugar:**
- Blood sugar is low (reactive hypoglycemia)
- [Thyroid function is suppressed (need quick energy)](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Insulin resistance prevents glucose from entering cells](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth)
- You're stressed (cortisol increases sugar cravings)

All of these are metabolic. Not psychological weakness.

## Low Blood Sugar Drives Cravings

[When blood sugar crashes, your brain panics](/blog/energy-crashes).

**What happens:**
1. You ate a meal 2-3 hours ago
2. [Insulin overshot (because of insulin resistance)](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth)
3. Blood sugar dropped too low
4. Brain detects low fuel
5. Intense craving for fast carbs

**You reach for:**
- Candy
- Cookies
- Soda
- Anything sugary

**This works:** Blood sugar rises fast. Brain calms down. Craving stops.

**Problem:** [Insulin overshoots again. Blood sugar crashes again. Cycle repeats](/blog/energy-crashes).

**Fix:** [Restore insulin sensitivity by eliminating PUFAs](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). [Eat balanced meals with protein, fat, and carbs](/blog/meal-planning).

## Low Thyroid Increases Cravings

[Low thyroid means low energy production](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

Your cells can't make ATP efficiently. You need constant external fuel.

**Sugar provides quick energy** when your metabolism is slow.

**But it's a band-aid.**

**Better fix:** [Support thyroid function](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). [Temperature climbs toward 98°F](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). Energy production improves. Need for constant sugar decreases.

## Stress and Cortisol

Stress increases sugar cravings. Cortisol raises blood sugar and increases appetite for sweets.

**Why:**
Your body thinks you need quick energy for fight-or-flight. Sugar provides that.

**[Fix stress](/blog/anxiety-pufas):**
- [Better sleep](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)
- [Appropriate exercise, not overtraining](/blog/exercise-metabolism)
- Manage psychological stress
- [Eat enough food (under-eating is metabolic stress)](/blog/meal-planning)

## How to Stop Craving Sugar

**Eliminate PUFAs.**
[This fixes insulin resistance](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat). Blood sugar stabilizes. Cravings reduce.

**Eat enough food.**
[Don't restrict calories](/blog/meal-planning). Under-eating worsens cravings. Eat to satiety.

**Eat balanced meals.**
Every meal needs protein, fat, and carbs. [Don't eat naked carbs](/blog/energy-crashes) (pasta without fat/protein).

**[Eat fruit liberally.](/blog/fructose-myth)**
Fruit satisfies sweet cravings. Provides nutrients. Doesn't trigger the same insulin spike as processed sugar.

**Don't skip meals.**
[Skipping meals creates blood sugar crashes](/blog/energy-crashes). Crashes create intense cravings.

**[Support thyroid.](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)**
Adequate carbs, iodine, selenium. [Track temperature](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism).

Most people notice:
- Week 1-2: Cravings reduce slightly
- Week 3-4: Significant reduction
- Month 2-3: Rare cravings, easy to ignore

## What About "Sugar Addiction"

Sugar isn't addictive like drugs.

**It's rewarding:** Activates dopamine. Feels good. But so does all pleasurable food.

**True addiction:** Physical dependence. Withdrawal symptoms. Escalating use despite harm.

**Sugar:** Metabolic need misinterpreted as addiction.

[Fix metabolism](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). "Addiction" disappears.

## Can You Eat Sugar After Metabolism Is Fixed

Yes. Occasionally.

**When metabolism is healthy:**
- [Temperature 98°F+](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- [Insulin sensitivity restored](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth)
- [Thyroid function normal](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)

**Occasional sugar is fine:**
- Dessert at celebrations
- Honey in yogurt
- Homemade treats

**Avoid:**
- Daily processed sugar
- Sugar combined with seed oils (most packaged treats)
- Using sugar to boost energy (means metabolism still broken)

## FAQ

**Q: Should I quit sugar cold turkey?**
A: No need. [Replace processed sugar with fruit](/blog/fructose-myth). [Eat balanced meals](/blog/meal-planning). Cravings reduce naturally. Don't create unnecessary suffering.

**Q: What about artificial sweeteners?**
A: Some people tolerate them. Others find they maintain sweet cravings. [Try eliminating for 30 days](/blog/tracking-symptoms). See if cravings improve.

**Q: Is fruit just as bad as candy?**
A: [No. Fruit has fiber, vitamins, water](/blog/fructose-myth). Absorption is slower. Doesn't spike blood sugar the same way.

**Q: How long until cravings stop?**
A: Most people see significant reduction within 3-4 weeks of [eliminating PUFAs](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge) and [stabilizing blood sugar](/blog/meal-planning).

# Is Olive Oil Actually Healthy?

## TL;DR

Olive oil is better than canola or soybean oil. Still contains 10% PUFAs (linoleic acid). Industry is rife with fraud—most "extra virgin" olive oil is adulterated with cheaper seed oils. Don't cook with olive oil (oxidizes easily). Use cold on salads in small amounts. Butter, ghee, and coconut oil are better choices. Olive oil is marketed as healthier than it is.

You switched to olive oil.

"Heart-healthy." "Mediterranean diet." "Rich in antioxidants."

Better than canola. That's what you heard.

You cook with it. Drizzle it on everything. Buy expensive bottles.

"Extra virgin." "Cold-pressed." "Italian."

Olive oil is better than seed oils. [But not as healthy as you think](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat).

*Olive oil is like diet soda. Better than regular soda. Still not good for you.*

## What's in Olive Oil

**Fatty acid composition:**

**Monounsaturated fat (oleic acid):** 70-80%
**Saturated fat:** 10-15%
**Polyunsaturated fat (PUFAs):** 10%

**That 10% PUFA is linoleic acid.**

[Same PUFA in seed oils](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). [Same metabolic effects](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

**For comparison:**
- Butter: 3% PUFA
- Coconut oil: 2% PUFA
- Canola oil: 28% PUFA
- Soybean oil: 55% PUFA

**Olive oil is better than industrial seed oils.**

[Still contains more PUFAs than butter or coconut oil](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat).

## The Olive Oil Fraud Problem

**70-80% of "extra virgin olive oil" sold in US is fraudulent.**

**Common frauds:**
- Mixed with cheaper seed oils (soybean, sunflower, canola)
- Labeled "extra virgin" when it's refined
- [Fake Italian origin (bottled in Italy, made elsewhere)](/blog/reading-food-labels)
- Rancid oil sold as fresh

**UC Davis study (2010):**
Tested 124 imported olive oil samples. [69% failed purity standards](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress). [Cut with seed oils](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge).

**Your "Italian olive oil" might be:**
- 50% canola oil
- From Spain, Tunisia, or Turkey (not Italy)
- Months or years old (rancid)

**[You think you're avoiding seed oils](/blog/reading-food-labels). You're not.**

## Why Olive Oil Gets a Health Halo

**"Mediterranean diet" studies.**

**The claim:**
People in Mediterranean regions eat olive oil. [Have lower heart disease](/blog/cholesterol-myth). Therefore olive oil is healthy.

**The problem:**
- [They also eat fish, vegetables, walk daily, less stress](/blog/meal-planning)
- [They don't eat processed food, seed oils, or fast food](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge)
- [Olive oil isn't the only variable](/blog/pufas-inflammation)

**Also:**
Traditional Mediterranean diet used olive oil raw on salads. [Not for high-heat cooking](/blog/cooking-basics). [Modern use is different](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress).

**Olive oil industry is massive.**

[Marketing budgets rival pharmaceutical companies](/blog/cholesterol-myth). ["Heart-healthy" claims everywhere](/blog/pufas-inflammation). [Doesn't mean it's optimal](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

## Cooking with Olive Oil

**Olive oil smoke point: 375-405°F**

**Frying, sautéing, roasting = 400-450°F**

**[When you heat olive oil above smoke point:](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress)**
- [PUFAs oxidize](/blog/pufas-inflammation)
- Creates harmful compounds
- [Damages metabolism](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)

**Even "high-quality" olive oil degrades at high heat.**

**Better for cooking:**
- Butter (smoke point 350°F, but more stable due to low PUFA)
- Ghee (smoke point 485°F)
- Coconut oil (smoke point 350°F, very stable)
- Tallow (smoke point 420°F)

**[If using olive oil, use it cold](/blog/cooking-basics).**

On salads. Drizzled over cooked vegetables. Not for frying.

## Real Extra Virgin vs. Fake

**How to identify real extra virgin olive oil:**

**Look for:**
- Harvest date (within past year)
- Single origin (specific region, farm)
- Dark glass bottle (protects from light)
- Certification seals (DOP, PDO)
- Price ($20+ per liter minimum)

**Avoid:**
- Clear plastic bottles
- [No harvest date](/blog/reading-food-labels)
- ["Light" or "pure" olive oil (refined)](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress)
- Cheap ($8-12 per liter)
- Generic "product of Italy" labels

**Best brands (less likely to be adulterated):**
- California Olive Ranch
- Kirkland Organic (Costco)
- Cobram Estate
- Kasandrinos

**Even these aren't perfect.**

[Fraud is widespread](/blog/reading-food-labels). [Test results vary](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress).

## Olive Oil vs. Butter

**Per 100g:**

**Olive oil:**
- 10g PUFA
- 73g monounsaturated fat
- 14g saturated fat
- [Oxidizes when heated](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress)

**Butter:**
- 3g PUFA
- 21g monounsaturated fat
- 51g saturated fat
- [More stable, less oxidation](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat)
- [Contains vitamins A, D, K2](/blog/vitamin-d-metabolism)

**[Butter is superior for metabolism](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).**

Lower PUFA. More nutrients. [Supports thyroid](/blog/thyroid-medication).

## When Olive Oil Is Okay

**Small amounts, used cold:**

**Salad dressing:**
- 1-2 tablespoons olive oil
- [Mixed with vinegar or lemon](/blog/meal-planning)
- [Not heated](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress)

**Drizzled on cooked food:**
- Over roasted vegetables (after cooking)
- On pasta (after cooking)
- [Added at end, not during cooking](/blog/cooking-basics)

**Limit:**
[1-2 tablespoons per day maximum](/blog/reading-food-labels). [Even unheated, still 10% PUFA](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge).

## What to Use Instead

### **For Cooking:**

**Butter:**
- 3% PUFA
- Delicious flavor
- [Supports thyroid](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Use for sautéing, baking, everything](/blog/cooking-basics)

**Ghee:**
- 3% PUFA
- High smoke point
- [Lactose removed](/blog/pufas-gut-health)

**Coconut oil:**
- 2% PUFA
- Very stable
- [Medium-chain triglycerides](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat)

**Tallow, lard, duck fat:**
- 5-10% PUFA
- Traditional, nutritious
- [High smoke point](/blog/cooking-basics)

### **For Salads:**

**Option 1:** [Butter melted over warm vegetables](/blog/meal-planning)

**Option 2:** [Small amount olive oil + vinegar](/blog/reading-food-labels)

**Option 3:** [Tahini dressing (if tolerating sesame)](/blog/nuts-seed-oils)

**Option 4:** [Avocado oil (15% PUFA, slightly better than olive)](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat)

## The "Antioxidants in Olive Oil" Claim

**Olive oil contains polyphenols.**

**These are antioxidants.** [Claimed to offset oxidative damage](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress).

**Problem:**
- [Polyphenol content varies wildly](/blog/reading-food-labels)
- [Degrades over time (months)](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress)
- [Heating destroys polyphenols](/blog/cooking-basics)
- [May not be enough to offset PUFA damage](/blog/pufas-inflammation)

**Better sources of antioxidants:**
- [Berries](/blog/fructose-myth)
- [Leafy greens](/blog/meal-planning)
- [Coffee](/blog/coffee-thyroid)
- [Dark chocolate](/blog/fructose-myth)

**[Don't rely on olive oil for antioxidants](/blog/vitamin-d-metabolism).**

## Timeline After Switching from Olive Oil to Butter

**Week 2-4:**
- [Inflammation may decrease](/blog/pufas-inflammation)
- [Digestion improves (for some)](/blog/pufas-gut-health)

**Month 2-3:**
- [Skin may improve](/blog/skin-health-pufas)
- [Energy stabilizes](/blog/energy-crashes)

**Month 3-6:**
- [Stored PUFAs clearing](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge)
- [Metabolism improving](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)

**Change is subtle.**

[Olive oil is 10% PUFA, not 55% like soybean oil](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat). [Switching away helps, but less dramatic than eliminating canola](/blog/reading-food-labels).

## FAQ

**Q: Is olive oil bad for me?**
A: [Not as bad as seed oils](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). [But not optimal](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat). [Contains 10% PUFA](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). [Butter and coconut oil are better](/blog/cooking-basics).

**Q: Can I cook with olive oil?**
A: [Heating oxidizes PUFAs](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress). [Use butter or ghee for cooking](/blog/cooking-basics). [If using olive oil, use cold](/blog/meal-planning).

**Q: What about "light" olive oil?**
A: ["Light" = refined](/blog/reading-food-labels). [Stripped of antioxidants](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress). [Same PUFA content, less protection](/blog/pufas-inflammation). [Avoid](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge).

**Q: I bought expensive Italian olive oil. Is that safe?**
A: [Maybe](/blog/reading-food-labels). [70-80% of "extra virgin" is adulterated](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress). [Even real olive oil is still 10% PUFA](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat). [Use sparingly, cold](/blog/cooking-basics).

**Q: My Greek grandmother cooked with olive oil and lived to 95.**
A: [She also walked daily, ate real food, no processed junk, less stress](/blog/meal-planning). [She used small amounts](/blog/reading-food-labels). [She didn't fry in it at 450°F daily](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress). [Context matters](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

# Is High Cholesterol Really Dangerous?

## TL;DR

High cholesterol doesn't cause heart disease. Oxidized cholesterol (from PUFAs) causes arterial damage. Saturated fat doesn't raise cholesterol dangerously. Statins treat a number, not disease. Inflammation and insulin resistance drive heart disease, not cholesterol. Eliminate PUFAs. Eat saturated fats. Cholesterol normalizes.

Your cholesterol came back high.

Total: 240. LDL: 160. Your doctor is concerned.

"Heart disease risk. You need statins. Cut saturated fat. Eat more vegetable oil. Low-fat diet."

You followed orders. Ate margarine. Skinless chicken. Vegetable oil. Oatmeal.

Cholesterol dropped. You felt terrible. [Tired](/blog/energy-crashes). [Brain fog](/blog/brain-fog-pufas). [Low mood](/blog/depression-metabolism).

Then you learned the truth. Cholesterol isn't the enemy.

*Cholesterol is like firefighters at a fire. They're present at the scene. That doesn't mean they started the fire.*

## What Cholesterol Actually Does

**Cholesterol is essential for life.**

**Your body uses it for:**
- Cell membrane structure (every cell)
- [Hormone production (testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, cortisol)](/blog/testosterone-pufas)
- [Vitamin D synthesis](/blog/calcium-vitamin-d)
- Bile acids (fat digestion)
- Brain function (25% of body's cholesterol is in brain)

**Your liver makes 75% of your cholesterol.**

Only 25% comes from diet. [When you eat more, your liver makes less](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat). Your body regulates it.

**Cholesterol doesn't "clog arteries" like grease in pipes.**

This model is outdated. Heart disease is inflammatory, not mechanical.

## The Real Cause of Heart Disease

**Atherosclerosis (arterial plaque) forms from:**

**1. Arterial damage (inflammation)**
[Oxidized PUFAs damage arterial lining](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress). Endothelial cells get injured. [Inflammation begins](/blog/pufas-inflammation).

**2. Immune response**
White blood cells enter artery wall to repair damage. Form foam cells.

**3. Plaque formation**
Foam cells, oxidized LDL, calcium, and fibrous tissue build up. Plaque forms.

**4. Plaque rupture**
Unstable plaque breaks. Blood clot forms. Heart attack occurs.

**Cholesterol is present. But it's not the cause.**

[Inflammation is the cause](/blog/pufas-inflammation). [Oxidized PUFAs cause inflammation](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress).

## Oxidized LDL vs. Normal LDL

**Normal LDL cholesterol is harmless.**

It transports cholesterol and fats through bloodstream. Essential function.

**Oxidized LDL is dangerous.**

[When PUFAs oxidize, LDL particles carrying them also oxidize](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress). Oxidized LDL damages arteries.

**Standard cholesterol tests don't measure oxidation.**

They measure total LDL. Not oxidized LDL. [You can have high LDL with zero oxidation (safe) or low LDL with high oxidation (dangerous)](/blog/pufas-inflammation).

**What causes LDL oxidation:**
- [PUFAs in diet](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Chronic inflammation](/blog/pufas-inflammation)
- [High blood sugar (glycation)](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth)
- Smoking

**Saturated fat doesn't oxidize.** [It's chemically stable](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat).

## Saturated Fat Doesn't Cause Heart Disease

**The diet-heart hypothesis (1960s):**
Saturated fat → raises cholesterol → causes heart disease.

**This was wrong.**

**Modern research shows:**
- Saturated fat raises total cholesterol modestly
- But increases HDL (protective)
- Increases large, fluffy LDL (benign)
- Doesn't increase small, dense LDL (problematic)
- [Doesn't increase heart disease risk](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat)

**[PUFAs (seed oils) increase small, dense LDL](/blog/pufas-inflammation).** This is the dangerous type.

**Swap happened in 1960s-1980s:**
- Stop eating butter, lard, tallow
- Start eating margarine, vegetable oil, Crisco
- [Heart disease exploded](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat)

**Correlation? Yes. But opposite direction.**

## What About Statins

**Statins lower cholesterol by blocking liver production.**

**Benefits (modest):**
- May reduce heart attacks by 1-2% in high-risk people
- Anti-inflammatory effects (independent of cholesterol lowering)

**Side effects (common):**
- Muscle pain and weakness
- [Cognitive impairment (brain needs cholesterol)](/blog/brain-fog-pufas)
- [Fatigue](/blog/energy-crashes)
- [Low testosterone (cholesterol needed for hormone production)](/blog/testosterone-pufas)
- [Liver damage](/blog/pufas-gut-health)
- Increased diabetes risk

**Statins treat a number, not a disease.**

[They don't fix inflammation](/blog/pufas-inflammation). [They don't eliminate oxidized PUFAs](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). They don't reverse heart disease.

**Some people need statins** (familial hypercholesterolemia, already had heart attack). Most people don't.

## What Actually Predicts Heart Disease

**Better markers than total cholesterol:**

**1. Inflammation (CRP)**
[High-sensitivity CRP above 3.0 = high risk](/blog/pufas-inflammation). [Eliminate PUFAs](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). CRP drops.

**2. Insulin resistance**
[High fasting insulin or HbA1c indicates metabolic dysfunction](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth). [Fix diet](/blog/meal-planning). Insulin normalizes.

**3. Triglycerides/HDL ratio**
Should be under 2:1. High ratio = insulin resistance. [Reduce carb intake if very high](/blog/low-carb-thyroid). [Eliminate PUFAs](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge).

**4. Small, dense LDL**
Advanced lipid panel measures particle size. [Small, dense LDL is risky](/blog/pufas-inflammation). [PUFAs increase it](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress).

**5. Oxidized LDL**
Specialty test. High oxidized LDL = high risk. [Eliminate PUFAs](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). Oxidation drops.

**6. CAC score (calcium score)**
CT scan of coronary arteries. Measures calcified plaque. Best predictor of heart attack risk.

## How to Actually Prevent Heart Disease

**[Eliminate all PUFAs:](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge)**
[Stop eating seed oils](/blog/reading-food-labels). This is the primary intervention.

**[Eat saturated fats:](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat)**
- Butter, ghee, coconut oil
- Fatty meat, eggs, dairy
- [These don't oxidize](/blog/cooking-basics)

**[Support metabolic health:](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)**
- [Adequate carbs for thyroid](/blog/low-carb-thyroid)
- [Protein for muscle](/blog/meal-planning)
- [Reduce insulin resistance](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth)

**[Reduce inflammation:](/blog/pufas-inflammation)**
- [Eliminate PUFAs](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge)
- [Improve sleep](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)
- [Manage stress](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism)
- [Don't overtrain](/blog/exercise-metabolism)

**[Exercise moderately:](/blog/exercise-metabolism)**
- Walking daily
- Strength training 2-3x/week
- [Avoid chronic cardio](/blog/athletic-performance)

**Don't smoke.**

**Most people see:**
- Month 2-3: [Inflammation drops (CRP decreases)](/blog/pufas-inflammation)
- Month 3-6: [Insulin sensitivity improves](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth)
- Month 6-12: Lipid profile optimizes (HDL rises, triglycerides drop)

## What If Cholesterol Is Very High

**Total cholesterol above 300:**

**Possible causes:**
- Familial hypercholesterolemia (genetic)
- [Hypothyroidism (low thyroid raises cholesterol)](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Insulin resistance](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth)

**Get full panel:**
- Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides
- [Free T3, Free T4, TSH](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation)
- [Fasting insulin](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth)
- hsCRP
- Advanced lipid panel (particle size)

**If familial hypercholesterolemia:**
May need medication. Work with cardiologist. [But still eliminate PUFAs](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge)—reduces oxidation even if cholesterol stays high.

**[If hypothyroid:](/blog/thyroid-medication)**
[Fix thyroid](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Cholesterol often normalizes.

**If insulin resistant:**
[Fix diet](/blog/meal-planning). [Reduce refined carbs temporarily](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth). [Eliminate PUFAs](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). Re-test in 3 months.

## FAQ

**Q: My doctor says I need statins. What do I do?**
A: Get full lipid panel, CRP, CAC score if possible. [Ask about trying diet changes first (3-6 months)](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). If very high risk or family history, statins may be appropriate. Discuss with doctor.

**Q: Will eating eggs raise my cholesterol?**
A: Slightly, maybe. But [eggs raise HDL (good)](/blog/meal-planning) and don't increase heart disease risk. Eggs are healthy.

**Q: Should I worry about LDL over 160?**
A: Depends on other factors. If HDL is high, triglycerides low, CRP low, insulin normal—probably fine. [Context matters more than one number](/blog/pufas-inflammation).

**Q: Can I reverse atherosclerosis?**
A: Some evidence suggests [eliminating PUFAs, improving insulin sensitivity, and reducing inflammation can stabilize or slightly reverse plaque](/blog/pufas-inflammation). Takes years. Best approach: prevent progression.

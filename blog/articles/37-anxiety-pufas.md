# Does Poor Metabolism Cause Anxiety?

## TL;DR

Anxiety is often metabolic, not just psychological. Low blood sugar triggers adrenaline. Low thyroid increases stress hormones. Poor sleep worsens anxiety. PUFAs suppress metabolism and increase inflammation, creating biochemical anxiety. Fix metabolism, anxiety reduces or disappears for many people. Not all anxiety is metabolic, but most has a metabolic component.

Your heart races for no reason.

You wake up anxious. Tight chest. Racing thoughts. Sense of dread.

You're not stressed about anything specific. You just feel anxious. All the time.

Your doctor offers SSRIs. Benzos. Therapy.

These help. A little. But the anxiety never fully goes away.

Your brain isn't broken. Your metabolism is.

*Anxiety is like a car alarm going off. Sometimes someone's breaking in. Sometimes the sensor is faulty. PUFAs are the faulty sensor.*

## The Metabolic Roots of Anxiety

Your brain monitors your body's state constantly. When it detects problems, it triggers anxiety to get you to act.

**Metabolic problems your brain detects:**
- Low blood sugar (triggers fight-or-flight)
- Low oxygen (from poor circulation)
- Inflammation (activates immune-brain connection)
- High stress hormones (cortisol, adrenaline)
- Thyroid dysfunction (affects neurotransmitters)

[PUFAs cause all of these](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress).

Your brain thinks you're in danger. It's responding to real biochemical signals. But the danger isn't external. It's internal metabolic dysfunction.

## Low Blood Sugar and Adrenaline

[When blood sugar drops too low, your body releases adrenaline](/blog/energy-crashes).

**Adrenaline symptoms:**
- Racing heart
- Shaking
- Sweating
- Sense of panic
- Feeling like something bad is about to happen

This is identical to anxiety. Because it is anxiety. Your brain is responding to a survival threat (starvation signal).

**Why blood sugar crashes:**
[PUFAs cause insulin resistance](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth). Your pancreas overshoots. Blood sugar drops too low. Adrenaline kicks in.

This happens:
- Between meals (especially if you skip breakfast)
- Overnight (wake at 2-3 AM anxious, heart racing)
- After high-carb meals (reactive hypoglycemia)

**Fix:** [Eliminate PUFAs, restore insulin sensitivity](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). Eat balanced meals with protein, fat, and carbs. [Small carb snack before bed](/blog/body-temperature-sleep) if waking anxious.

## Low Thyroid and Stress Hormones

[Low thyroid function increases stress hormones](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

When metabolism is slow, your body uses adrenaline and cortisol to maintain function. You run on stress hormones instead of thyroid hormone.

**This creates:**
- Wired-but-tired feeling
- Can't relax
- Hypervigilance
- Overreacting to small stressors
- Constant low-level anxiety

[Your pulse might be elevated (above 85-90)](/blog/pulse-tracking-guide) even at rest. [But your temperature is low (below 97.8°F)](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). This confirms you're running on adrenaline, not metabolism.

**Fix:** [Support thyroid function](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Adequate carbs, iodine, eliminate PUFAs. [Consider thyroid medication if severely hypothyroid](/blog/thyroid-medication).

## Inflammation and Anxiety

[Your immune system communicates with your brain](/blog/pufas-inflammation).

When you have chronic inflammation (from PUFAs), inflammatory cytokines affect neurotransmitter production:
- Lower serotonin (mood regulation)
- Lower GABA (calming neurotransmitter)
- Higher glutamate (excitatory neurotransmitter)

**Result:**
- Anxiety
- Agitation
- Inability to calm down
- Overactive mind

[This is neuroinflammation](/blog/brain-fog-pufas). Not a psychological problem. A biochemical one.

**Fix:** [Eliminate PUFAs](/blog/pufas-inflammation). Reduce inflammation. [Support gut health](/blog/pufas-gut-health) (gut inflammation worsens neuroinflammation).

## Sleep Deprivation and Anxiety

[Poor sleep dramatically worsens anxiety](/blog/body-temperature-sleep).

One night of bad sleep increases anxiety the next day. Chronic sleep deprivation creates chronic anxiety.

[PUFAs suppress metabolism](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid), which disrupts circadian rhythm and sleep quality. You can't fall asleep. You wake frequently. You don't reach deep sleep.

Without restorative sleep:
- Cortisol stays elevated
- Inflammatory markers rise
- Neurotransmitter balance disrupts
- Anxiety skyrockets

**Fix:** [Optimize metabolic health for better sleep](/blog/body-temperature-sleep). Temperature rhythm, blood sugar stability, thyroid function all affect sleep.

## The Gut-Brain Connection

[Your gut produces neurotransmitters](/blog/pufas-gut-health).

90% of serotonin is made in your gut. GABA is produced by gut bacteria.

[PUFAs damage gut lining](/blog/pufas-gut-health). Leaky gut and dysbiosis disrupt neurotransmitter production.

**Result:**
- Low serotonin (anxiety, depression)
- Low GABA (can't calm down)
- Inflammation travels from gut to brain via vagus nerve

Many people with anxiety have gut issues: bloating, irregular bowel movements, food sensitivities.

**Fix:** [Heal gut lining](/blog/pufas-gut-health). Eliminate PUFAs. Eat easily digestible foods. Support beneficial bacteria.

## What You Notice

**Morning anxiety:**
Wake up anxious before your feet hit the floor. [Often low blood sugar from overnight crash](/blog/energy-crashes). Or high cortisol (dysregulated circadian rhythm).

**Anxiety after eating:**
[Blood sugar spike followed by crash](/blog/energy-crashes). Adrenaline releases. Feels like panic.

**Constant low-level anxiety:**
Never relaxed. Always on edge. [Usually low thyroid with compensatory stress hormones](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

**Panic attacks:**
Sudden intense anxiety. Racing heart, chest tightness, fear of dying. [Often triggered by blood sugar crashes or adrenaline surges](/blog/pulse-tracking-guide).

**Wired at night:**
Can't wind down. Mind racing. [Circadian rhythm disrupted](/blog/body-temperature-sleep). Cortisol too high at night.

**Anxiety without trigger:**
Free-floating anxiety. Nothing specific. [This is biochemical anxiety—your brain responding to metabolic dysfunction](/blog/brain-fog-pufas).

## How to Reduce Metabolic Anxiety

**Eliminate PUFAs immediately.**
[Stop eating seed oils](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). This reduces inflammation, supports thyroid, improves insulin sensitivity. Foundation of everything.

**Stabilize blood sugar.**
[Eat protein, fat, and carbs at every meal](/blog/meal-planning). Don't skip meals. [Small carb snack before bed if waking anxious](/blog/body-temperature-sleep).

**Support thyroid function.**
[Adequate carbohydrates, iodine, selenium](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). [Track temperature daily](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). Should climb toward 98°F. [Consider medication if severely hypothyroid](/blog/thyroid-medication).

**Prioritize sleep.**
[Fix circadian rhythm through metabolic optimization](/blog/body-temperature-sleep). Sleep in dark, cool room. Get morning sunlight. Eat carbs at dinner.

**[Heal your gut.](/blog/pufas-gut-health)**
Eliminate inflammatory foods. Eat easily digestible foods (meat, eggs, cooked vegetables, fruit, white rice). Support with bone broth, gelatin.

**Reduce stimulants.**
High caffeine intake worsens anxiety (raises cortisol and adrenaline). Reduce to 1-2 cups per day while fixing metabolism.

**[Exercise appropriately.](/blog/exercise-metabolism)**
Moderate activity reduces anxiety. Overtraining worsens it (increases cortisol). Walking and strength training are ideal. Avoid chronic cardio.

**[Track your data.](/blog/tracking-symptoms)**
Temperature, pulse, energy, sleep, anxiety levels. See what correlates. This reveals your specific triggers.

Most people see anxiety improve:
- Week 2-4: Less frequent panic attacks
- Week 4-6: Baseline anxiety reduces
- Month 2-3: Significant improvement, maybe occasional mild anxiety
- Month 6+: Most metabolic anxiety gone

## What About Therapy and Medication

Therapy helps with:
- Psychological stressors (relationship issues, trauma, work stress)
- Thought patterns and behaviors
- Coping strategies

But therapy can't fix:
- Low blood sugar
- Thyroid dysfunction
- Inflammation
- Sleep deprivation

**Medication (SSRIs, benzos) helps:**
- Increase serotonin (SSRIs)
- Calm nervous system (benzos)
- Provide relief while fixing root cause

**Limitations:**
- Don't address metabolic dysfunction
- Side effects (weight gain, sexual dysfunction, dependence)
- Difficult to discontinue

**Best approach:**
Fix metabolism first. Many people no longer need medication once metabolic health is restored. Some still benefit from medication even with optimized metabolism. Work with your doctor. Never stop anxiety medication abruptly.

## Not All Anxiety Is Metabolic

Some anxiety is purely psychological:
- PTSD
- Phobias
- Panic disorder
- Social anxiety (can have metabolic component but also psychological)

But most people with anxiety have metabolic contributing factors. Even if anxiety started from psychological trauma, metabolic dysfunction makes it worse.

**Fix the metabolic component.** Then address the psychological component if needed. You'll respond to therapy much better when your brain chemistry is optimized.

## FAQ

**Q: How long until anxiety improves after eliminating PUFAs?**
A: Most people notice improvement within 2-4 weeks. Significant reduction by 6-8 weeks. Full resolution (if metabolic) by 3-6 months. Track your symptoms weekly.

**Q: I have diagnosed panic disorder. Will this help?**
A: Panic disorder has biochemical triggers even if it's a psychological condition. Many people find panic attacks reduce in frequency and intensity when metabolism is optimized. Work with your doctor. Don't stop medication without supervision.

**Q: Can anxiety cause low metabolism or does low metabolism cause anxiety?**
A: Both directions. Chronic psychological stress suppresses thyroid. Low thyroid creates biochemical anxiety. It's a cycle. Break the cycle by fixing metabolism and managing stress.

**Q: What if I'm anxious but my labs are "normal"?**
A: ["Normal" labs don't mean optimal cellular function](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation). [Check Free T3, not just TSH](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation). [Track temperature and pulse](/blog/tracking-symptoms). These reveal more than standard lab tests.

# Why Do You Crash After Eating? The Blood Sugar Rollercoaster

## TL;DR

Post-meal crashes happen when insulin overshoots and blood sugar drops too low. This is caused by insulin resistance from PUFAs. Broken cell membranes don't respond to insulin properly. Your pancreas overcompensates. Blood sugar swings wildly. Eliminate PUFAs, restore insulin sensitivity, energy stabilizes.

You eat lunch.

Within 30 minutes, you're exhausted. Brain fog hits. You need a nap. Or more food. Or coffee.

Every meal does this. Breakfast, lunch, dinner. The pattern never changes.

Food should give you energy. Instead it drains you.

Your blood sugar is on a rollercoaster. [PUFAs broke the controls](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth).

*Blood sugar regulation is like a thermostat. PUFAs are like someone constantly adjusting it. The temperature swings wildly and never stabilizes.*

## What Should Happen After Eating

Normal blood sugar response:

1. You eat food containing carbohydrates
2. Blood sugar rises gradually
3. Pancreas releases appropriate amount of insulin
4. Insulin signals cells to absorb glucose
5. Blood sugar returns to baseline (80-90 mg/dL)
6. Energy is steady, sustained

You feel good. Focused. Energized from the meal.

**With insulin resistance:**

1. You eat food containing carbohydrates
2. Blood sugar rises rapidly (cells aren't absorbing well)
3. Pancreas releases excessive insulin (compensating for resistance)
4. Eventually cells respond (hours later, from massive insulin)
5. Blood sugar plummets below baseline (reactive hypoglycemia)
6. Energy crashes
7. You're hungry, shaky, foggy, exhausted
8. You eat again to feel better
9. Cycle repeats

This is the blood sugar rollercoaster.

## Why PUFAs Cause This

[PUFAs incorporate into cell membranes](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat). [They oxidize and change membrane structure](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress).

**Insulin receptors sit in cell membranes.** When membranes are full of oxidized PUFAs, receptors don't work properly.

**Result:** [Insulin resistance](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth).

Your cells ignore insulin's signal. Glucose can't enter. Blood sugar stays high. Your pancreas makes more insulin.

Eventually, the massive insulin overcomes resistance. Glucose floods into cells. Blood sugar drops too far, too fast.

You crash.

## What You Feel

**30-60 minutes after eating:**
- Sudden fatigue (need to lie down)
- Brain fog (can't think clearly)
- Shakiness or jitteriness
- Anxiety or irritability
- Hunger (even though you just ate)
- Cold or clammy feeling
- Heart palpitations

**You reach for:**
- More food (creates another cycle)
- Coffee (masks the crash temporarily)
- Sugar (quick fix that makes it worse)

This happens most with:
- High-carb meals (bread, pasta, rice without adequate fat/protein)
- Meals cooked in seed oils (worsens insulin resistance)
- Breakfast (worst time for crashes in insulin-resistant people)
- Large meals (bigger glucose load = bigger crash)

## The Dawn Phenomenon

You wake up hungry. Shaky. Anxious. Sometimes sweating.

This is reactive hypoglycemia overnight.

**What happened:**
1. You ate dinner
2. Blood sugar rose
3. [Insulin overshot (insulin resistance from PUFAs)](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth)
4. Blood sugar dropped low overnight
5. Your body released cortisol and adrenaline to raise it
6. You wake up wired but exhausted

[This disrupts sleep](/blog/body-temperature-sleep). You wake at 2-3 AM. Can't fall back asleep. Morning comes and you're wrecked.

**Solution:** Small carb snack before bed. Fruit, honey in milk, potato with butter. This stabilizes blood sugar overnight. Once insulin sensitivity is restored, you won't need this.

## Breakfast Makes It Worse

"Breakfast is the most important meal" is wrong for many people with insulin resistance.

**Morning cortisol is naturally high.** This raises blood sugar to wake you up (cortisol mobilizes glucose).

When you eat breakfast:
- You add food glucose on top of elevated baseline
- Your insulin-resistant cells don't respond well
- Pancreas overreacts
- You crash by 10 AM

**Better approach while healing:**
- Skip breakfast or eat later (10-11 AM)
- Or eat protein/fat breakfast with minimal carbs (eggs and bacon, no toast or juice)
- Save carbs for lunch and dinner when cortisol is lower

Once insulin sensitivity is restored, breakfast works fine.

## How to Fix Energy Crashes

**Eliminate PUFAs completely.**
[Stop eating seed oils immediately](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). Cell membranes need to rebuild with saturated fats. This restores insulin receptor function. Takes 2-3 months.

**Eat balanced meals.**
Every meal needs:
- Protein (meat, eggs, dairy, fish)
- Fat (butter, coconut oil)
- Carbs (fruit, potatoes, rice)

Don't eat naked carbs (pasta with no fat/protein). Always pair carbs with fat and protein. This slows absorption, prevents spikes.

**[Support thyroid function.](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)**
Low thyroid worsens insulin resistance. [Eat adequate carbohydrates](/blog/meal-planning). Track your temperature—should be 98°F+.

**Don't eat huge meals.**
Eat moderate portions every 4-5 hours. Overloading your system worsens crashes.

**Consider meal timing.**
If breakfast crashes you, skip it or eat later. If late dinner disrupts sleep, eat earlier or have small carb snack before bed.

**Track your response.**
[Monitor energy after meals](/blog/tracking-symptoms). Which meals make you crash? Which don't? Adjust accordingly.

**Be patient.**
Insulin sensitivity takes weeks to months to restore fully. Early changes help (better meal composition), but full resolution requires cell membrane turnover.

Most people see improvement:
- Week 1-2: Less severe crashes with better meal composition
- Week 4-6: Noticeably more stable energy
- Month 3-6: Crashes gone, stable energy all day

## What About Continuous Glucose Monitors

CGMs show real-time blood sugar. They can be useful.

**What they reveal:**
- How your blood sugar responds to specific foods
- How quickly you crash after meals
- How stable you are overnight
- Effect of stress, sleep, exercise on blood sugar

**Limitations:**
- Expensive ($100-200/month)
- Don't measure insulin (can have normal glucose with high insulin—still problematic)
- Can cause anxiety (obsessing over numbers)

Useful for learning your patterns. Not necessary long-term. [Track symptoms instead](/blog/tracking-symptoms) (energy, warmth, mental clarity). These matter more than numbers.

## What Not to Do

**Don't go low-carb long-term.**
[Low-carb suppresses thyroid function](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). This worsens insulin sensitivity eventually. You need carbs for healthy metabolism.

**Don't eat every 2 hours.**
"Graze to stabilize blood sugar" is bad advice. This keeps insulin elevated constantly. Makes insulin resistance worse. Eat 3 meals, maybe 1-2 snacks. Let insulin drop between meals.

**Don't rely on stimulants.**
Coffee masks crashes but doesn't fix them. High caffeine intake can worsen blood sugar swings (raises cortisol). Use moderately while fixing root cause.

**Don't fear fruit.**
[Fructose doesn't spike blood sugar the same way glucose does](/blog/fructose-myth). Fruit with its fiber is well-tolerated by most people. Some of your carbs should come from fruit.

## FAQ

**Q: I crash after eating carbs but feel fine on keto. Should I stay keto?**
A: Keto avoids the problem by eliminating carbs. But [it suppresses thyroid long-term for many people](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Better to fix insulin sensitivity so you can eat carbs without crashing. Try 3-6 months of PUFA elimination with moderate carbs before committing to keto forever.

**Q: Is reactive hypoglycemia the same as diabetes?**
A: No. Diabetes is high blood sugar from insufficient insulin. Reactive hypoglycemia is low blood sugar from excessive insulin. Both involve insulin problems but opposite directions. Reactive hypoglycemia can lead to diabetes eventually if not addressed.

**Q: Should I eat small frequent meals to prevent crashes?**
A: No. This keeps insulin elevated constantly, worsening insulin resistance. Eat 3 solid meals. Stable energy between meals means insulin sensitivity is improving.

**Q: What if I feel great on low-carb but my temperature is low?**
A: Low temperature indicates suppressed metabolism. You're running on stress hormones (cortisol, adrenaline), not thyroid. This works short-term but crashes eventually. [Add carbs back gradually while eliminating PUFAs](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

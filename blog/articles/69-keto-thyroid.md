# Does Keto Suppress Your Thyroid Function?

## TL;DR

Keto suppresses thyroid in most people. Low carbs reduce T4-to-T3 conversion. T3 drops. Metabolism slows. Initial weight loss from water and fat. Then plateau. Energy crashes. Sleep worsens. Women lose periods. Add back carbs (150-250g daily). Temperature rises. Metabolism recovers. Fat loss resumes eating more food.

You started keto.

First month was great. Lost ten pounds. [Mental clarity](/blog/brain-fog-pufas). Energy high.

Month two. Three. Four. Weight loss stopped. [Energy crashed](/blog/energy-crashes). [Can't sleep](/blog/body-temperature-sleep). [Mood tanked](/blog/depression-metabolism).

Women: [period disappeared](/blog/pufas-womens-hormones). Men: [libido gone](/blog/testosterone-pufas).

You added more fat. Cut carbs to zero. Tried carnivore.

Still broken. [Cold all the time](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). [Hair falling out](/blog/hair-loss-pufas). Exhausted.

Keto worked. Then it destroyed your thyroid.

*Keto is like running a car on reserve fuel. Works short-term. But engine wasn't designed for it long-term. Eventually, it breaks down.*

## How Keto Suppresses Thyroid

**Thyroid hormone conversion requires glucose.**

[Your thyroid makes T4 (inactive form). Your cells convert T4 to T3 (active form). T3 drives metabolism](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

**Conversion requires:**
- Glucose
- Insulin (signals fed state)
- Selenium
- Zinc
- Adequate calories

**On keto:**
- Very low glucose
- Low insulin (signals starvation)
- [Body perceives scarcity](/blog/intermittent-fasting)

**Result:**
- [T4-to-T3 conversion decreases](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- T4 converts to Reverse T3 (inactive, blocks T3)
- Free T3 drops
- [Metabolism slows](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)

**This is physiological.** Not pathological. But problematic long-term.

## The Timeline

**Week 1-4 (honeymoon phase):**
- Water weight drops (5-10 lbs)
- Ketones rise (mental clarity)
- [Appetite decreases](/blog/craving-sugar)
- Fat burning increases
- Energy feels good (running on stress hormones)

**Week 5-12 (adaptation struggles):**
- Weight loss slows or stops
- [Energy becomes inconsistent](/blog/energy-crashes)
- [Sleep quality declines](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)
- [Exercise performance drops](/blog/exercise-metabolism)
- [Mood swings increase](/blog/anxiety-pufas)

**Month 4+ (metabolic suppression):**
- [Temperature drops below 97.8°F](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- [Chronic fatigue](/blog/energy-crashes)
- [Hair loss](/blog/hair-loss-pufas)
- [Women: irregular or missing periods](/blog/pcos-seed-oils)
- [Men: low testosterone symptoms](/blog/testosterone-pufas)
- Can't lose more weight despite extreme restriction

**Some people do fine on keto.** Most don't long-term.

## Who Keto Helps (Short-Term)

**Good candidates for 4-12 weeks:**
- Severe insulin resistance (pre-diabetes, type 2 diabetes)
- [Very high triglycerides](/blog/cholesterol-myth)
- Epilepsy (therapeutic use)
- [Metabolically healthy men (tolerate better than women)](/blog/pufas-womens-hormones)

**Even then:**
[Monitor thyroid function](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation). [Track temperature](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). [Add carbs back if symptoms develop](/blog/low-carb-thyroid).

## Who Keto Hurts

**Bad candidates:**
- [Women trying to conceive](/blog/pregnancy-pufas)
- [Women with PCOS or hormone issues](/blog/pcos-seed-oils)
- [Anyone with existing hypothyroid](/blog/thyroid-medication)
- [Athletes](/blog/athletic-performance)
- [People with history of disordered eating](/blog/anxiety-pufas)
- [Chronic stress or poor sleep](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism)

**For these groups:**
[Keto often worsens symptoms](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). [Carbs are needed](/blog/meal-planning).

## Keto vs. Low-Carb vs. Moderate-Carb

**Keto (under 50g carbs):**
- Suppresses thyroid in most people
- Not sustainable long-term for most
- May help severe insulin resistance short-term

**Low-carb (50-100g):**
- [Still suppresses thyroid for many](/blog/low-carb-thyroid)
- Better than keto but not optimal
- May work for metabolically healthy men

**Moderate-carb (150-250g):**
- [Supports thyroid function](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Sustainable long-term](/blog/meal-planning)
- [Allows athletic performance](/blog/athletic-performance)
- [Maintains hormones](/blog/pufas-womens-hormones)
- Works for most people

**[We recommend moderate-carb for metabolic optimization](/blog/meal-planning).**

## How to Transition Off Keto

**If keto suppressed your thyroid:**

**Step 1: Add carbs gradually**
- Week 1: Add 50g carbs daily ([fruit, white rice](/blog/meal-planning))
- Week 2: Add another 50g (total 100g)
- Week 3: Add another 50g (total 150g)
- Stabilize at 150-250g daily

**Step 2: Expect temporary weight gain**
- Glycogen refills (1g carbs holds 3-4g water)
- Gain 3-7 lbs in week 1-2 (water, not fat)
- This is GOOD. [Metabolism recovering](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism).

**Step 3: Monitor temperature**
- [Track waking oral temperature daily](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- Should rise from <97.8°F toward 98.0-98.6°F
- Rising temperature = thyroid recovering

**Step 4: Be patient**
- Week 2-4: [Energy stabilizes](/blog/energy-crashes)
- Week 4-8: [Temperature normalizes](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism), [sleep improves](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)
- Month 3-6: [Hormones return](/blog/pufas-womens-hormones), [hair regrows](/blog/hair-loss-pufas), fat loss resumes

**Most people feel dramatically better within 8 weeks of adding carbs back.**

## What About "Clean Keto"

**Clean keto (whole foods, no seed oils):**
Better than standard keto (which often includes seed oils in dressings, fat bombs, etc.).

**But still:**
[Low carbs still suppress thyroid](/blog/low-carb-thyroid). [Whether carbs come from whole foods or not doesn't matter](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). [Thyroid needs glucose](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

**[Best approach:](/blog/meal-planning)**
- Whole foods (yes)
- [No seed oils (yes)](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge)
- [Adequate carbs 150-250g](/blog/meal-planning) (yes)

## Testing Your Thyroid on Keto

**If doing keto, monitor thyroid:**

**Labs every 3 months:**
- TSH
- Free T4
- [Free T3](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation)
- [Reverse T3](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation)

**Red flags:**
- [Free T3 dropping (even if still in "normal" range)](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation)
- [Reverse T3 rising](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation)
- TSH rising above 2.0

**If these occur:**
[Add carbs back immediately](/blog/low-carb-thyroid). [Don't wait for severe symptoms](/blog/hair-loss-pufas).

## Can You Do Keto Long-Term?

**Some people can.** Minority.

**Indicators you might tolerate keto:**
- [Temperature stays 98°F+](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- [Energy remains high](/blog/energy-crashes)
- [Sleep quality stays good](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)
- [Women: periods remain regular](/blog/pufas-womens-hormones)
- [Men: libido and strength normal](/blog/testosterone-pufas)
- [Athletic performance maintained](/blog/athletic-performance)

**[Most people don't meet these criteria on long-term keto](/blog/exercise-metabolism).**

**If you develop symptoms:**
[Add carbs](/blog/meal-planning). [Don't force a diet that's breaking your body](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

## FAQ

**Q: I lost weight on keto. Why should I add carbs?**
A: [If temperature is below 97.8°F, metabolism is suppressed](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). Weight loss will plateau. [Adding carbs recovers metabolism](/blog/low-carb-thyroid). Long-term fat loss improves.

**Q: Won't adding carbs make me gain fat?**
A: You'll gain 3-7 lbs of water (glycogen stores). Then weight stabilizes. [As thyroid recovers, fat loss resumes](/blog/weight-loss-plateaus). [You'll lose more fat eating more food](/blog/meal-planning).

**Q: Can I do keto if I eliminate PUFAs?**
A: [Eliminating PUFAs helps](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). But [low carbs still suppress thyroid](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). [Better: eliminate PUFAs AND eat adequate carbs](/blog/meal-planning).

**Q: What about cyclical keto (carb refeeds)?**
A: Better than strict keto. But still suboptimal for most. [Consistent moderate carbs work better for thyroid function](/blog/meal-planning).

# How to Read Your Thyroid Labs (What Your Doctor Won't Tell You)

## TL;DR

TSH alone doesn't tell the full story. Most doctors only test TSH and call you "normal" even when Free T3 is low. Optimal ranges differ from lab ranges. TSH under 2.5, Free T3 in upper half of range, Reverse T3 under 15, Free T4 mid-range. Request full panel: TSH, Free T4, Free T3, Reverse T3, thyroid antibodies. Many people have subclinical hypothyroidism that doctors miss.

Your doctor tested your thyroid.

TSH came back "normal." 3.8 mIU/L.

"Your thyroid is fine. Nothing wrong."

But you're [exhausted](/blog/energy-crashes). [Gaining weight](/blog/weight-loss-plateaus). [Can't think clearly](/blog/brain-fog-pufas). [Always cold](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism).

Your doctor didn't test Free T3. Didn't check Reverse T3. Just TSH.

[You have hypothyroidism](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Doctor missed it.

*Thyroid labs are like checking gas gauge but ignoring engine. Gauge says "half full." Engine doesn't start.*

## The Standard Thyroid Panel (Insufficient)

**Most doctors order:**
- TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone)

**That's it.**

**Why this misses problems:**
- [TSH is pituitary hormone, not thyroid hormone](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [TSH can be "normal" while Free T3 is low](/blog/thyroid-medication)
- [Doesn't measure active thyroid hormone](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Doesn't show conversion problems](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism)

**[TSH alone is useless for diagnosing subclinical hypothyroidism](/blog/thyroid-medication).**

## What Each Marker Means

### **TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone)**

**What it is:**
Pituitary hormone that signals thyroid to produce hormones.

**How it works:**
- High TSH = pituitary asking for more thyroid hormone (hypothyroid)
- Low TSH = pituitary satisfied, doesn't need more (hyperthyroid)

**Lab "normal" range:**
0.4 - 4.5 mIU/L

**Optimal range:**
0.5 - 2.5 mIU/L

**Problems with TSH:**
- [Doesn't measure actual thyroid hormone](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Can stay "normal" while T3 drops](/blog/thyroid-medication)
- [Increases with age (makes hypothyroidism look normal)](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Varies throughout day](/blog/tracking-symptoms)

**[TSH above 2.5 = possible subclinical hypothyroidism](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).**

### **Free T4 (Free Thyroxine)**

**What it is:**
Inactive thyroid hormone produced by thyroid gland.

**How it works:**
[T4 converts to T3 (active form) in liver and other tissues](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

**Lab "normal" range:**
0.8 - 1.8 ng/dL

**Optimal range:**
1.0 - 1.5 ng/dL (mid-range)

**What high Free T4 means:**
- [Taking too much thyroid medication](/blog/thyroid-medication)
- [Poor T4-to-T3 conversion](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism)
- Hyperthyroidism

**What low Free T4 means:**
- [Hypothyroidism](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Thyroid gland not producing enough](/blog/autoimmune-pufas)
- [Iodine deficiency](/blog/electrolytes-salt)

### **Free T3 (Free Triiodothyronine)**

**What it is:**
Active thyroid hormone. [The one that actually matters](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

**How it works:**
[T3 binds to receptors in every cell](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). [Controls metabolism, energy production, body temperature](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism).

**Lab "normal" range:**
2.3 - 4.2 pg/mL

**Optimal range:**
3.2 - 4.2 pg/mL (upper half)

**[This is the most important thyroid marker](/blog/thyroid-medication).**

**What low Free T3 means:**
- [Poor T4-to-T3 conversion](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Low thyroid function despite "normal" TSH](/blog/thyroid-medication)
- [Hypothyroid symptoms](/blog/energy-crashes)

**What high Free T3 means:**
- [Taking too much T3 medication](/blog/thyroid-medication)
- Hyperthyroidism (rare)

**[You can have "normal" TSH and low Free T3](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).**

[This is subclinical hypothyroidism](/blog/thyroid-medication). [Doctors miss it constantly](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

### **Reverse T3 (rT3)**

**What it is:**
Inactive form of T3. [Metabolic brake](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism).

**How it works:**
[When body is stressed, converts T4 to Reverse T3 instead of active T3](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism). [Reverse T3 blocks T3 receptors](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). [Slows metabolism](/blog/weight-loss-plateaus).

**Lab "normal" range:**
9 - 25 ng/dL

**Optimal range:**
Under 15 ng/dL

**What high Reverse T3 means:**
- [Chronic stress](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism)
- [Calorie restriction](/blog/intermittent-fasting)
- [Overtraining](/blog/exercise-metabolism)
- [Inflammation](/blog/pufas-inflammation)
- [Low thyroid function despite normal T4](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)

**High Reverse T3 = metabolic suppression.**

[Even if Free T3 looks okay](/blog/thyroid-medication), [high rT3 blocks its action](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

### **Thyroid Antibodies**

**Two main types:**

**TPO (Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies):**
- Indicates Hashimoto's thyroiditis (autoimmune hypothyroid)
- Normal: under 35 IU/mL
- [Elevated = immune system attacking thyroid](/blog/autoimmune-pufas)

**Thyroglobulin Antibodies (TgAb):**
- Also indicates Hashimoto's
- Normal: under 20 IU/mL
- [Often elevated alongside TPO](/blog/autoimmune-pufas)

**If antibodies are elevated:**
[You have Hashimoto's](/blog/autoimmune-pufas). [Thyroid is being destroyed by immune system](/blog/pufas-inflammation). [Address root cause (PUFAs, inflammation, gut health)](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge).

## Optimal Ranges vs. Lab Ranges

**Lab ranges are statistical averages.**

Include sick people. Include elderly. [Include people with undiagnosed hypothyroidism](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

**Optimal ranges = what healthy metabolism looks like.**

**Comparison:**

| Marker | Lab "Normal" | Optimal |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| TSH | 0.4 - 4.5 mIU/L | 0.5 - 2.5 mIU/L |
| Free T4 | 0.8 - 1.8 ng/dL | 1.0 - 1.5 ng/dL |
| Free T3 | 2.3 - 4.2 pg/mL | 3.2 - 4.2 pg/mL |
| Reverse T3 | 9 - 25 ng/dL | Under 15 ng/dL |
| TPO antibodies | Under 35 IU/mL | Under 10 IU/mL |

**[You can be "normal" and still hypothyroid](/blog/thyroid-medication).**

## Common Patterns

### **Pattern 1: High TSH, Low Free T3**
- Clear hypothyroidism
- [Thyroid not producing enough](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Likely needs medication or root cause work](/blog/thyroid-medication)

### **Pattern 2: Normal TSH, Low Free T3**
- [Subclinical hypothyroidism](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Poor T4-to-T3 conversion](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism)
- [Doctors call this "normal"â€”it's not](/blog/thyroid-medication)

### **Pattern 3: Normal TSH, High Reverse T3**
- [Chronic stress](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism)
- [Calorie restriction or overtraining](/blog/intermittent-fasting)
- [Body converting T4 to inactive form](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)

### **Pattern 4: High TSH, Normal Free T3, Elevated Antibodies**
- [Hashimoto's in early stages](/blog/autoimmune-pufas)
- [Thyroid being destroyed slowly](/blog/pufas-inflammation)
- [Will progress to full hypothyroidism without intervention](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge)

### **Pattern 5: Low Free T4, Low Free T3, High TSH**
- [Severe hypothyroidism](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Thyroid gland failing](/blog/autoimmune-pufas)
- [Needs immediate treatment](/blog/thyroid-medication)

## Why Doctors Miss Subclinical Hypothyroidism

**Reason 1: Only test TSH**
[TSH can be "normal" while Free T3 is low](/blog/thyroid-medication). [Doctor never checks Free T3](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

**Reason 2: Use lab ranges, not optimal ranges**
[TSH of 3.8 is "normal" but suboptimal](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). [Should be under 2.5](/blog/thyroid-medication).

**Reason 3: Don't test Reverse T3**
[Reverse T3 blocks thyroid function](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism). [Most doctors don't order this test](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

**Reason 4: Ignore symptoms**
["Labs are normal, so you're fine"](/blog/tracking-symptoms) even when [you're exhausted, cold, gaining weight](/blog/energy-crashes).

**Reason 5: Don't understand root causes**
[PUFAs suppress thyroid](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). [Stress suppresses conversion](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism). [Doctors don't ask about diet](/blog/meal-planning).

## How to Request Proper Testing

**What to ask for:**

"I'd like a comprehensive thyroid panel including:
- TSH
- Free T4
- Free T3
- Reverse T3
- TPO antibodies
- Thyroglobulin antibodies"

**If doctor refuses:**
"I'm experiencing symptoms of hypothyroidism. [Fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, brain fog](/blog/tracking-symptoms). I'd like to rule out conversion problems and autoimmune thyroid disease."

**If still refuses:**
Order labs yourself through:
- Ulta Lab Tests
- Request A Test
- Walk-In Lab

Cost: $100-150 for full panel.

## When to Retest

**Initial optimization:**
- Test baseline
- [Make changes (eliminate PUFAs, support thyroid)](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge)
- Retest in 8-12 weeks

**On thyroid medication:**
- Retest 6-8 weeks after dose change
- [Once stable, retest every 6 months](/blog/thyroid-medication)

**Tracking progress:**
- [Retest every 3-6 months while optimizing](/blog/tracking-symptoms)
- [Use temperature and pulse for daily tracking](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)

## What to Do With Results

**If TSH above 2.5 and Free T3 below 3.2:**
[Support thyroid naturally](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid):
- [Eliminate PUFAs](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge)
- [Adequate carbs (150-200g daily)](/blog/low-carb-thyroid)
- [Adequate calories](/blog/intermittent-fasting)
- [Reduce stress](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism)
- [Improve sleep](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)

**If TSH above 4.0:**
[Discuss thyroid medication with doctor](/blog/thyroid-medication). [Likely need T4 (levothyroxine) or combination T4/T3](/blog/thyroid-medication).

**If Reverse T3 above 15:**
[Address chronic stress](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism):
- [Reduce training volume](/blog/exercise-metabolism)
- [Stop calorie restriction](/blog/weight-loss-plateaus)
- [Improve sleep](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)
- [Manage work stress](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism)

- [Heal gut](/blog/pufas-gut-health)
- [Reduce inflammation](/blog/pufas-inflammation)

## FAQ

**Q: My TSH is 3.5. Doctor says it's normal. Should I be concerned?**
A: [Optimal is under 2.5](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). [Request Free T3 test](/blog/thyroid-medication). [If Free T3 is low (under 3.2), you have subclinical hypothyroidism](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

**Q: Why won't my doctor test Free T3?**
A: [Most doctors rely on TSH alone](/blog/thyroid-medication). [Not trained to look for conversion problems](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). [Order labs yourself if needed](/blog/tracking-symptoms).

**Q: Can I have hypothyroidism with normal TSH?**
A: [Yes](/blog/thyroid-medication). [TSH measures pituitary signal, not actual thyroid hormone](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). [You can have normal TSH and low Free T3](/blog/thyroid-medication).

**Q: What if my Free T3 is low but doctor won't treat?**
A: [Try natural optimization first](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). [Eliminate PUFAs, support thyroid, fix sleep](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). [Retest in 8-12 weeks](/blog/tracking-symptoms). [If still low, find doctor willing to treat](/blog/thyroid-medication).

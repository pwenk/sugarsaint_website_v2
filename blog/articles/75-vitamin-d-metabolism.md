# What's the Optimal Vitamin D Level for Metabolism?

## TL;DR

Vitamin D supports thyroid, testosterone, immune function, and bone health. Optimal level: 40-60 ng/mL (not 30). Get sun when possible. Supplement 2,000-5,000 IU daily if deficient. Take with fat for absorption. Retest every 3-6 months. Higher isn't always better—overdosing causes problems.

---

Your vitamin D came back low.

18 ng/mL. Doctor says "take 1,000 IU daily."

You take it. Retest six months later. Still 22 ng/mL. Barely moved.

[You're still tired](/blog/energy-crashes). [Still getting sick](/blog/pufas-inflammation). [Mood is low](/blog/depression-metabolism).

1,000 IU isn't enough. [Your levels are still too low](/blog/tracking-symptoms).

*Vitamin D is like fuel in your tank. "Enough to avoid empty" isn't the same as "full tank for optimal performance."*

## What Vitamin D Does

**Vitamin D is actually a hormone.**

Made in skin from sunlight. Or obtained from food/supplements.

**Functions:**
- [Calcium absorption (bone health)](/blog/calcium-vitamin-d)
- [Immune system regulation](/blog/pufas-inflammation)
- [Thyroid hormone production](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Testosterone production in men](/blog/testosterone-pufas)
- Cell growth and differentiation
- [Mood regulation](/blog/depression-metabolism)

**Deficiency causes:**
- Weak bones ([osteoporosis, rickets](/blog/calcium-vitamin-d))
- Frequent illness
- [Fatigue](/blog/energy-crashes)
- [Depression](/blog/depression-metabolism)
- [Muscle weakness](/blog/exercise-metabolism)
- [Poor wound healing](/blog/pufas-gut-health)

## Optimal Vitamin D Levels

**Standard reference range:**
30-100 ng/mL (75-250 nmol/L)

**"Sufficient" according to labs:**
Above 30 ng/mL

**Actually optimal:**
**40-60 ng/mL**

**Why higher is better:**

**Below 30 ng/mL:**
Deficient. [Bone health suffers](/blog/calcium-vitamin-d). [Immune function weak](/blog/autoimmune-pufas).

**30-40 ng/mL:**
Adequate for bone health. Not optimal for metabolic function.

**40-60 ng/mL:**
- [Optimal immune function](/blog/pufas-inflammation)
- [Best testosterone levels in men](/blog/testosterone-pufas)
- [Thyroid function supported](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Reduced inflammation](/blog/inflammation-markers)
- [Mood benefits](/blog/depression-metabolism)

**Above 60 ng/mL:**
May not provide additional benefit. Some risk of hypercalcemia if very high (80+).

**Aim for 40-60 ng/mL.**

## How to Get Vitamin D

### **Sunlight (Best Source)**

**UV-B rays convert cholesterol in skin to vitamin D3.**

**How much:**
- 15-30 minutes of midday sun
- Arms and legs exposed (no sunscreen initially)
- Fair skin: 15-20 minutes
- Dark skin: 30-45 minutes (melanin blocks UV-B)

**When:**
- 10am-3pm (when UV-B is strongest)
- Spring through fall (winter sun too weak in northern latitudes)

**Problems:**
- Winter months (no vitamin D production above 35° latitude)
- Indoor lifestyle
- Sunscreen blocks vitamin D production
- [Fear of sun exposure](/blog/skin-health-pufas)

**Sun is ideal.** But most people need supplementation part or all of year.

### **Food Sources (Limited)**

**Vitamin D from food is minimal:**

- Fatty fish (salmon, mackerel): 400-1,000 IU per serving
- Egg yolks: 40 IU per yolk
- Liver: 40-50 IU per serving
- Fortified milk: 100 IU per cup

**Eating these helps.** But won't raise levels significantly if deficient.

### **Supplements**

**When needed:**
- Vitamin D below 40 ng/mL
- Limited sun exposure
- Winter months

**Form:**
- Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) - best absorbed
- Not D2 (ergocalciferol) - less effective

**Dosage:**
- **If deficient (below 30 ng/mL):** 5,000 IU daily for 3 months, then retest
- **If low-normal (30-40 ng/mL):** 2,000-4,000 IU daily
- **Maintenance (40-60 ng/mL):** 1,000-2,000 IU daily (or periodic sun exposure)

**Take with fat:**
Vitamin D is fat-soluble. [Take with meal containing butter, eggs, or fatty meat](/blog/meal-planning).

**Retest every 3-6 months** until stable in optimal range.

## Vitamin D and Thyroid

**[Low vitamin D impairs thyroid function.](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)**

Studies show:
- Vitamin D deficiency associated with hypothyroidism
- [Low D linked to Hashimoto's (autoimmune thyroid)](/blog/autoimmune-pufas)
- Vitamin D receptors present in thyroid tissue

**Optimizing vitamin D may:**
- [Improve thyroid hormone production](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Reduce thyroid antibodies](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation)
- [Support T4-to-T3 conversion](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)

**[Not a cure.](/blog/thyroid-medication)** But supportive.

## Vitamin D and Testosterone

**[Low vitamin D = low testosterone in men.](/blog/testosterone-pufas)**

**Mechanism:**
- Vitamin D supports Leydig cells (produce testosterone)
- Vitamin D regulates enzyme converting cholesterol to testosterone

**Studies show:**
- Men with D below 30 ng/mL have lower testosterone
- Supplementing to 40-60 ng/mL increases testosterone modestly

**Won't fix severe hypogonadism.** But [helps optimize levels](/blog/testosterone-pufas).

## Vitamin D and Immunity

**[Vitamin D regulates immune system.](/blog/pufas-inflammation)**

**Optimal levels (40-60 ng/mL):**
- [Reduced risk of autoimmune flares](/blog/autoimmune-pufas)
- Fewer colds and infections
- [Better response to illness](/blog/pufas-inflammation)

**Deficiency:**
- Frequent illness
- [Chronic infections](/blog/pufas-gut-health)
- [Autoimmune conditions worsen](/blog/autoimmune-pufas)

**Many people notice they get sick less** once vitamin D is optimized.

## How Much Is Too Much

**Toxicity is rare but possible.**

**Symptoms of excess (usually above 100 ng/mL):**
- Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium)
- Nausea
- [Constipation](/blog/pufas-gut-health)
- Kidney stones
- Confusion

**Safe upper limit:**
- 10,000 IU daily is generally safe for most people
- But unnecessary—most need 2,000-5,000 IU

**[Track levels with blood tests.](/blog/tracking-symptoms)** Don't mega-dose blindly.

## Vitamin D and Calcium

**[Vitamin D helps absorb calcium.](/blog/calcium-vitamin-d)**

But high-dose vitamin D without adequate vitamin K2 can cause problems:
- Calcium deposits in soft tissues
- Arterial calcification
- Kidney stones

**[Eat vitamin K2-rich foods:](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat)**
- Grass-fed butter
- Egg yolks
- Natto (fermented soybeans—if tolerated)
- Aged cheese

**Or supplement K2:**
- 100-200 mcg MK-7 form daily

**[Magnesium also important:](/blog/electrolytes-salt)**
[Vitamin D requires magnesium for activation](/blog/electrolytes-salt). [Supplement magnesium glycinate 300-400mg daily](/blog/electrolytes-salt).

## Testing Vitamin D

**Test: 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]**

**When to test:**
- Baseline (if never tested)
- 3 months after starting supplementation
- Every 6-12 months for maintenance

**Cost:**
- Through doctor: usually covered by insurance
- Direct lab (LabCorp, Quest): $40-60

**Goal:**
40-60 ng/mL

## FAQ

**Q: Can I get too much vitamin D from sun?**
A: No. Skin regulates production. Can't overdose from sun. [Supplement overdose is possible](/blog/tracking-symptoms).

**Q: Should I take vitamin D year-round?**
A: Depends on sun exposure and levels. [Test to know](/blog/tracking-symptoms). Many people need supplementation October-March in northern climates.

**Q: What if my level is 80 ng/mL?**
A: Higher than needed. Reduce supplement dose. Retest in 3 months. Levels above 100 ng/mL require medical evaluation.

**Q: Can vitamin D help weight loss?**
A: Indirectly. [Supports thyroid and testosterone](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid), [which support metabolism](/blog/weight-loss-plateaus). [Not a weight loss supplement](/blog/meal-planning). But optimizing levels helps.

# Is Your Depression Actually Low Metabolism?

## TL;DR

Depression symptoms overlap with low thyroid: fatigue, low motivation, brain fog, hopelessness. PUFAs suppress thyroid and cause neuroinflammation—both create depression. SSRIs treat symptoms, not cause. Fix metabolism: eliminate PUFAs, support thyroid, eat adequate carbs. Many people's depression lifts when metabolism heals.

You're depressed.

No energy. No motivation. Everything feels heavy. [Can't think clearly](/blog/brain-fog-pufas). Don't enjoy things you used to love.

Your doctor prescribed SSRIs. Wellbutrin. Therapy. "Chemical imbalance."

The medication helped some. Or didn't. Or worked then stopped. You've tried three different antidepressants.

Still depressed. Still exhausted. Still struggling.

What if it's not a serotonin problem? What if [your thyroid is suppressed](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)?

*Depression is like a car running out of gas. You can adjust the steering (therapy), tune the radio (medication). But until you fill the tank (metabolism), the car won't run.*

## Depression or Low Thyroid?

**Classic depression symptoms:**
- Persistent sadness
- [Low energy, fatigue](/blog/energy-crashes)
- Loss of interest in activities
- [Difficulty concentrating](/blog/brain-fog-pufas)
- [Sleep problems](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)
- Appetite changes
- Hopelessness
- Suicidal thoughts

**Classic hypothyroid symptoms:**
- [Persistent fatigue](/blog/energy-crashes)
- [Low energy](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- Loss of motivation
- [Brain fog](/blog/brain-fog-pufas)
- [Sleep problems](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)
- Weight gain despite low appetite
- Feeling cold
- Hopelessness

**Notice the overlap?**

[Low thyroid causes depression symptoms](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Fix thyroid. "Depression" often resolves.

## How Low Thyroid Causes Depression

**T3 (active thyroid hormone) is needed for brain function.**

[Low T3 means:](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- Reduced neurotransmitter production (serotonin, dopamine)
- [Lower brain energy (glucose metabolism)](/blog/brain-fog-pufas)
- Slower neuronal firing
- [Impaired mitochondrial function](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress)

**Brain can't function properly.**

You feel foggy. Unmotivated. Sad. This isn't psychological. [It's metabolic](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

**[Standard thyroid testing misses this.](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation)**

TSH looks "normal." But Free T3 is low. Reverse T3 is high. [T4-to-T3 conversion is blocked](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

Your doctor says thyroid is fine. Prescribes antidepressants. [Doesn't fix the root cause](/blog/thyroid-medication).

## PUFAs and Neuroinflammation

**[PUFAs cross the blood-brain barrier.](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress)**

Brain is 60% fat. [When you eat PUFAs, they integrate into brain tissue](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat).

**[PUFAs oxidize.](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress)**

Oxidized fats in brain → [neuroinflammation](/blog/pufas-inflammation) → depression symptoms.

**Neuroinflammation causes:**
- [Reduced serotonin synthesis](/blog/anxiety-pufas)
- Increased inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha)
- [Mitochondrial dysfunction (less ATP)](/blog/energy-crashes)
- [Disrupted sleep](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)
- [Memory problems](/blog/brain-fog-pufas)

**This is why some depressed people have high CRP (inflammation marker).**

[It's not "just" psychological depression](/blog/pufas-inflammation). It's inflammatory depression.

## SSRIs Don't Fix Metabolism

**SSRIs increase serotonin availability.**

They can help symptoms. For some people.

**But they don't:**
- [Fix thyroid suppression](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Reduce neuroinflammation](/blog/pufas-inflammation)
- [Improve mitochondrial function](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress)
- [Restore brain energy metabolism](/blog/brain-fog-pufas)

**SSRIs are a bandaid.**

[Fix the root cause](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). Many people reduce or eliminate antidepressants as metabolism heals.

**Work with your doctor. Don't stop medication without supervision.**

## How to Fix Metabolic Depression

**[Eliminate all PUFAs:](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge)**
Stop eating seed oils. [Every meal with vegetable oil suppresses thyroid](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid) and [increases inflammation](/blog/pufas-inflammation).

**[Support thyroid function:](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)**
- Eat adequate carbs (150-250g daily)
- Iodine from seafood or iodized salt
- Selenium from Brazil nuts or meat
- [Track morning temperature (goal: 98°F+)](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)

**[Eat for brain health:](/blog/meal-planning)**
- [Adequate carbs (glucose for brain energy)](/blog/low-carb-thyroid)
- Protein (amino acids for neurotransmitters)
- [Saturated fats (stable brain structure)](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat)
- Liver (B vitamins, choline, vitamin A)
- [Egg yolks (choline, DHA)](/blog/cooking-basics)
- [Dairy (if tolerated)](/blog/calcium-vitamin-d)

**[Improve sleep:](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)**
Depression worsens with poor sleep. [Sleep improves as thyroid function restores](/blog/body-temperature-sleep).

**[Light exposure:](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)**
Morning sunlight supports circadian rhythm. Helps thyroid function. Boosts mood.

**[Gentle exercise:](/blog/exercise-metabolism)**
Walking, not intense training. [Overtraining worsens depression](/blog/exercise-metabolism).

**Timeline:**
- Week 2-4: [Energy improves slightly](/blog/energy-crashes)
- Month 2-3: [Brain fog lifts](/blog/brain-fog-pufas), [mood stabilizes](/blog/anxiety-pufas)
- Month 3-6: [Motivation returns](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism), depression significantly improves
- Month 6-12: Most metabolic depression resolves

## When It's Not Just Metabolic

**Some depression is situational:**
- Grief, loss, trauma
- Life circumstances
- Chronic stress

**Metabolic optimization helps.** But therapy and support are also important.

**Some depression is genetic/neurological:**
- Bipolar disorder
- Severe treatment-resistant depression
- Psychotic depression

**These need medical treatment.** But [optimizing metabolism improves outcomes even in severe cases](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

## Testing to Consider

**Thyroid panel (full):**
- TSH (should be under 2.0)
- Free T4
- [Free T3 (should be in upper half of range)](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation)
- [Reverse T3](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation)

**Inflammation markers:**
- [CRP (should be under 1.0)](/blog/pufas-inflammation)
- ESR

**Nutrient levels:**
- [Vitamin D (depression link if low)](/blog/calcium-vitamin-d)
- [B12 (neurological function)](/blog/pufas-gut-health)
- [Iron (fatigue if deficient)](/blog/energy-crashes)
- [Magnesium](/blog/electrolytes-salt)

**Cortisol (saliva test):**
- 4-point throughout day
- [High cortisol = metabolic stress](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism)

## Medication Considerations

**If you're on antidepressants:**
- Don't stop without doctor supervision
- [Optimize metabolism alongside medication](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- Many people reduce doses as symptoms improve
- Work with psychiatrist for tapering

**If considering starting antidepressants:**
- [Try metabolic fixes first (4-8 weeks)](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge)
- If no improvement, medication may help
- Combination (medication + metabolic fix) often works best

**Thyroid medication:**
- [If Free T3 is low despite normal TSH](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation)
- [Consider T3 medication](/blog/thyroid-medication)
- Can dramatically improve depression in hypothyroid patients

## FAQ

**Q: I've been depressed for years. Can metabolism really fix it?**
A: If depression is metabolic (low thyroid, inflammation), yes. [Fix metabolism](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). If symptoms don't improve after 6 months, other factors are involved.

**Q: Should I stop my antidepressants?**
A: Never stop without doctor supervision. [Optimize metabolism while on medication](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Discuss tapering with doctor once symptoms improve.

**Q: My thyroid labs are "normal" but I'm still depressed.**
A: ["Normal" reference ranges are too wide](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation). [Optimal Free T3 is upper half of range](/blog/thyroid-medication). Ask for full panel including Free T3 and Reverse T3.

**Q: How long until I feel better?**
A: Most people notice [energy improvements week 2-4](/blog/energy-crashes). [Mood improves month 2-3](/blog/anxiety-pufas). Full recovery 6-12 months if depression is primarily metabolic.

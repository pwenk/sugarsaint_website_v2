# Why Is Your Hair Falling Out? The PUFA-Thyroid Connection

## TL;DR

Hair loss is a thyroid problem. Low thyroid means slow cell turnover, weak hair follicles, and telogen effluvium. PUFAs suppress thyroid and cause inflammation—both kill hair growth. Fix metabolism: eliminate PUFAs, support thyroid, wait 3-6 months. Hair regrows when metabolism heals.

Your hair is falling out.

Handfuls in the shower. Clumps on your pillow. Your hairline is receding. Thinning on top.

You tried biotin. Rogaine. Expensive shampoos. Scalp treatments.

Nothing works. Your hair keeps falling.

Your doctor checked your thyroid. Said it's "normal." Blamed stress. Or genetics.

[Your thyroid isn't normal](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation). And stress didn't cause this.

*Hair is like grass. It needs fertile soil to grow. Low thyroid is drought. PUFAs are poison. Nothing grows.*

## What Hair Needs to Grow

**Active thyroid hormone (T3):**
Hair follicles need T3 to progress through growth phases. [Low T3 means slow cell division](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Growth phase shortens. Resting phase lengthens. More hairs fall. Fewer regrow.

**Adequate blood flow:**
Scalp circulation delivers nutrients to follicles. [Low metabolism means poor circulation](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). Follicles starve.

**Low inflammation:**
Chronic inflammation damages follicles. [PUFAs cause systemic inflammation](/blog/pufas-inflammation). Hair follicles suffer.

**Hormone balance:**
- [Women: estrogen and progesterone support hair thickness](/blog/pufas-womens-hormones)
- [Men: DHT sensitivity varies, but low thyroid worsens pattern baldness](/blog/testosterone-pufas)

**Without these, hair falls out.**

## How PUFAs Cause Hair Loss

**They suppress thyroid.**
[Low T3 directly causes telogen effluvium](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid) (hair shedding). Your hair enters resting phase prematurely. Follicles shrink. Hair thins.

**They cause inflammation.**
PUFAs oxidize. Oxidized fats trigger immune response. [Inflammation damages hair follicles](/blog/pufas-inflammation). Scarring alopecia can develop in severe cases.

**They disrupt hormones.**
- [Women: estrogen dominance from PUFA storage](/blog/pufas-womens-hormones)
- [Men: lower testosterone, worse DHT sensitivity](/blog/testosterone-pufas)
- Both: cortisol elevation from chronic stress response

**They impair protein synthesis.**
[Damaged gut reduces nutrient absorption](/blog/pufas-gut-health). Less biotin, zinc, iron. Hair needs these. Can't grow without them.

## The Thyroid Connection

Most hair loss is thyroid-related.

**Hair follicle phases:**
1. **Anagen (growth):** 2-6 years
2. **Catagen (transition):** 2-3 weeks
3. **Telogen (resting):** 3-4 months
4. **Exogen (shedding):** Hair falls out

**Normal cycle:**
85-90% of hairs in anagen. 10-15% in telogen. You lose 50-100 hairs per day. Unnoticeable.

**Low thyroid cycle:**
More hairs enter telogen prematurely. Anagen phase shortens. Telogen extends. You lose 200-300+ hairs per day. Very noticeable.

**This is telogen effluvium.** It's reversible.

[Fix thyroid](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Hair regrows.

## Pattern Baldness vs. Telogen Effluvium

**Male/female pattern baldness:**
- Genetic sensitivity to DHT
- Follicles miniaturize over time
- Hairline recession, crown thinning
- Slow progression

**Telogen effluvium:**
- Diffuse thinning (all over scalp)
- Sudden increase in shedding
- Triggered by metabolic stress
- Reversible

**[Low thyroid worsens both](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation).**

Even genetic hair loss accelerates when metabolism is broken. Fix thyroid first. Pattern baldness may still progress, but slower.

## How to Stop Hair Loss

**Eliminate PUFAs completely.**
[Every seed oil meal suppresses your thyroid](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). Stop eating them. This is non-negotiable.

**[Support thyroid function:](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)**
- Adequate carbs (150g+ daily)
- Iodine from seafood or iodized salt
- Selenium from Brazil nuts or meat
- [Track temperature (goal: 98°F+)](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)

**Get key nutrients:**
- Iron (red meat, liver)
- Zinc (oysters, beef)
- Biotin (eggs, liver)
- Vitamin A (liver, butter)

**Reduce stress:**
[High cortisol suppresses thyroid and accelerates hair loss](/blog/anxiety-pufas). [Improve sleep](/blog/body-temperature-sleep). Lower training volume if overtrained. Manage psychological stress.

**Be patient:**
Hair growth takes 3-6 months. You'll notice shedding stops within 4-8 weeks. New growth visible at 3 months. Full thickness returns at 6-12 months.

## What About Treatments

**Minoxidil (Rogaine):**
- Extends anagen phase
- Works for pattern baldness
- Must use forever
- Doesn't fix root cause

**Finasteride/Dutasteride:**
- Blocks DHT
- Works for male pattern baldness
- Side effects: sexual dysfunction, depression
- Doesn't fix root cause

**Our take:**
These treat symptoms, not cause. [Fix metabolism first](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). If pattern baldness persists after thyroid optimization, consider treatments.

**Don't need:**
- Biotin supplements (unless labs show deficiency)
- Special shampoos (don't fix thyroid)
- Scalp treatments (don't fix metabolism)
- PRP injections (expensive, temporary)

Fix the root cause. Most hair loss reverses.

## Timeline for Recovery

**Week 1-4:**
Shedding continues. This is normal. Your hair cycle takes time to reset.

**Week 4-8:**
Shedding slows. You notice fewer hairs in shower.

**Week 8-12:**
[Temperature normalizes](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). [Energy improves](/blog/energy-crashes). Hair shedding is minimal.

**Month 3-6:**
Baby hairs appear at hairline. Existing hair thickens. Coverage improves.

**Month 6-12:**
Full recovery for most people. Hair thickness returns to baseline (or better).

**Permanent pattern baldness won't fully reverse.** But metabolic optimization slows progression significantly.

## FAQ

**Q: I'm losing 200+ hairs per day. Is this normal?**
A: No. Normal is 50-100. [Check thyroid labs](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation). Likely telogen effluvium from low T3.

**Q: My thyroid labs are "normal" but my hair is falling out.**
A: [Standard reference ranges are too wide](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation). TSH should be under 2.0. Free T3 should be in upper half of range. If not, thyroid is suppressed.

**Q: Will PUFAs cause permanent hair loss?**
A: Telogen effluvium is reversible. Scarring alopecia from severe inflammation is rare but possible. Most people recover fully once metabolism is fixed.

**Q: Should I take biotin supplements?**
A: Only if labs show deficiency. Most people get enough from eggs and meat. [Fix thyroid first](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)—biotin won't help if metabolism is broken.

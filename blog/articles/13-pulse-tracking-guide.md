# How to Track Your Pulse for Metabolic Health?

## TL;DR

Your resting pulse reflects metabolic rate and stress levels. 75-85 bpm is optimal for adults. Below 70 usually means low thyroid function. Above 90 means stress or overtraining. Track pulse alongside temperature for complete metabolic picture. Measure first thing in morning and mid-afternoon.

You track everything else. Steps. Calories. Macros.

But you ignore the signal your body sends 70 times per minute.

Your pulse isn't just your heart beating. It's your metabolism talking.

*Your pulse is the speedometer. Temperature is the fuel gauge. Together they show how your metabolic engine runs.*

## Why Pulse Matters

Your heart rate reflects two things: metabolic rate and stress.

High metabolism means more blood flow. More oxygen delivery. More nutrients to cells. Your heart beats stronger and faster to support this.

Low metabolism means less cellular demand. Your heart slows down. Weak pulse. Low bpm.

But high stress also raises pulse. Adrenaline and cortisol. Your body thinks it needs to run or fight.

This is why you track pulse WITH temperature. Temperature shows metabolic rate. Pulse shows metabolic rate + stress.

## Optimal Pulse Range

**Resting pulse for healthy adults: 75-85 bpm**

Below 70: Usually indicates low metabolic rate. Often correlates with low body temperature. Thyroid function likely suppressed.

70-75: Low-normal. Room for improvement.

75-85: Optimal. Good metabolic rate. Adequate stress response.

85-95: High-normal. Check if you're stressed or overtraining.

Above 95 at rest: High stress, anxiety, overtraining, or hyperthyroid. Needs attention.

Athletes sometimes have lower resting pulse. But if you're not training intensely and your pulse is below 70, that's low metabolism, not fitness.

## How to Track It

**Equipment needed:** Your fingers. Or a heart rate monitor. No fancy tools required.

**When to measure:**

1. **First thing in morning.** Before getting out of bed. This is your true resting pulse. Take it right after your morning temperature.

2. **Mid-afternoon.** After lunch. This shows how you respond to food and stress during the day.

**How to measure manually:**

Place two fingers on your wrist or neck. Find your pulse. Count beats for 60 seconds. Or count for 15 seconds and multiply by 4.

Be consistent. Same method. Same time. Same position.

Write it down. Date and number. That's it.

## What Affects Your Pulse

**Low pulse (below 70):**
- Low thyroid function ([often from PUFAs](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid))
- Not enough carbohydrates
- Chronic calorie restriction
- Overtraining without recovery
- Certain medications (beta-blockers)

**High pulse (above 90 at rest):**
- Chronic stress
- Caffeine overuse
- Poor sleep
- Overtraining
- Dehydration
- Anxiety
- Hyperthyroidism

**Normal pulse with low temperature:**
- Your metabolism is low but you're compensating with stress hormones (adrenaline). This is common. Not sustainable.

**High pulse with high temperature:**
- Good metabolic rate but too much stress. Need to address recovery.

## What You Do

**Track morning pulse daily for 3 weeks.** Same time. Same method. Watch for patterns.

**If pulse is below 70 consistently:**
- Eliminate seed oils ([they suppress thyroid](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid))
- Eat more carbohydrates (fruit, potatoes, rice, honey)
- Check if you're under-eating
- Reduce training volume if overtraining

**If pulse is above 90 consistently:**
- Reduce caffeine
- Improve sleep quality ([better temperature rhythm helps](/blog/body-temperature-sleep))
- Lower training intensity
- Address chronic stress
- Consider adrenal support

**If pulse is normal but temperature is low:**
- You're running on adrenaline. This masks low thyroid function. Fix metabolism first (eliminate PUFAs, eat enough carbs).

Most people see pulse improve within 2-4 weeks of fixing diet. Temperature climbs. Pulse strengthens. Energy stabilizes.

## What to Track

Keep a simple log:

```
Date | Morning Pulse | Afternoon Pulse | Notes
10/23 | 68 | 72 | Felt cold all day
10/24 | 70 | 75 | Better energy
10/25 | 72 | 76 | Warm hands, good focus
```

Look for trends. Week-to-week improvement matters more than day-to-day variation.

If you're making dietary changes, track pulse alongside symptoms. As PUFAs clear from your system, pulse usually increases toward 75-85 range.

## FAQ

**Q: I'm an athlete with a pulse of 55. Is that bad?**
A: Depends. If you're training hard, recovering well, and have good energy and warm body temperature, it's athletic adaptation. If you're cold, tired, and struggling, it's overtraining with low thyroid function.

**Q: My pulse jumps from 70 to 95 when I stand up. Is that normal?**
A: Some increase is normal. But a jump of 25+ bpm suggests orthostatic intolerance or POTS. Usually related to low blood volume, dehydration, or adrenal dysfunction. Check with a doctor.

**Q: Can pulse be too high even with good metabolism?**
A: Yes. High stress or anxiety raises pulse without improving metabolism. You want strong pulse in the 75-85 range, not racing pulse above 90.

**Q: How long until pulse improves after diet changes?**
A: Most people see changes within 2-4 weeks of eliminating seed oils and eating adequate carbs. Full optimization takes 2-3 months as cell membranes rebuild.

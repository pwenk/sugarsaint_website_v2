# Are Nut and Seed Oils Better Than Vegetable Oils?

## TL;DR

Nut and seed oils (walnut, almond, flaxseed, sesame) are still high in PUFAs. "Cold-pressed" or "organic" doesn't make them safe. They oxidize easily and suppress metabolism like industrial seed oils. Whole nuts in moderation are fine (PUFAs stay stable inside the nut). Nut oils are not. Avoid flaxseed oil, walnut oil, sesame oil, almond oil. Cook with butter and coconut oil instead.

You stopped using canola oil.

Switched to "healthier" oils. Walnut oil. Almond oil. [Sesame oil](/blog/reading-food-labels). Flaxseed oil for omega-3s.

"Cold-pressed." "Organic." Premium price. Health food store.

You think these are better.

They're not.

[Still PUFAs](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat). [Still oxidize](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress). [Still suppress metabolism](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

*Nut oils are like artisanal cigarettes. Better marketing. Same damage.*

## What Nut and Seed Oils Are

**Extracted from nuts or seeds.**

**Common types:**
- Walnut oil
- Almond oil
- Flaxseed oil (linseed oil)
- Sesame oil
- Pumpkin seed oil
- Sunflower seed oil
- Safflower seed oil
- Grapeseed oil

**Marketing claims:**
- "Cold-pressed" (less processing than industrial oils)
- "Organic" (no pesticides)
- "Rich in omega-3s" (especially flax)
- "Heart-healthy" (standard nonsense)

**Reality:**
[All are high in PUFAs](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). [All oxidize when exposed to heat, light, or air](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress). [All suppress thyroid and metabolism](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

## PUFA Content of Nut and Seed Oils

**Percentage of fat that is PUFA:**

**Very high (70-80% PUFA):**
- Walnut oil: 75%
- Grapeseed oil: 70%
- Sunflower oil: 65-70%
- Safflower oil: 75%
- Flaxseed oil: 73%

**High (40-60% PUFA):**
- Sesame oil: 42%
- Pumpkin seed oil: 50%

**Moderate (20-30% PUFA):**
- Almond oil: 26%
- Peanut oil: 32%

**For comparison:**
- Butter: 3% PUFA
- Coconut oil: 2% PUFA
- [Olive oil: 10% PUFA](/blog/olive-oil-truth)

**[Any oil above 10% PUFA is problematic](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat).**

## Why "Cold-Pressed" Doesn't Help

**Cold-pressed means:**
Extracted without high heat. Mechanical pressing only.

**This prevents:**
Some oxidation during processing.

**This doesn't prevent:**
- [Oxidation once bottle is opened](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress)
- [Oxidation when exposed to light](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress)
- [Oxidation when used for cooking](/blog/cooking-basics)
- [Oxidation inside your body](/blog/pufas-inflammation)

**[PUFAs are unstable](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress).**

"Cold-pressed" delays oxidation. [Doesn't eliminate it](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge).

**Once oil is extracted from the nut:**
[PUFAs are vulnerable](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress). [Oxidize rapidly](/blog/pufas-inflammation). [Damage metabolism](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

## Why "Organic" Doesn't Help

**Organic means:**
No synthetic pesticides or GMOs.

**This prevents:**
Pesticide residue in final product.

**This doesn't prevent:**
- [PUFA oxidation](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress)
- [Metabolic suppression](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Inflammation](/blog/pufas-inflammation)
- [Thyroid damage](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)

**Organic walnut oil is still 75% PUFA.**

[Same metabolic damage as conventional walnut oil](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge).

**Organic matters for produce.** [Doesn't matter for high-PUFA oils](/blog/reading-food-labels).

## Flaxseed Oil and Omega-3s

**Flaxseed oil is marketed for omega-3 content.**

**Contains:**
Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a plant-based omega-3.

**Problem:**
- [ALA is a PUFA](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat)
- [Oxidizes extremely easily (more than omega-6)](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress)
- Converts poorly to EPA/DHA (1-10% conversion rate)
- [Causes same metabolic suppression as omega-6 PUFAs](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)

**Flaxseed oil is worse than most other oils.**

[Most unstable](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress). [Oxidizes within weeks of opening](/blog/reading-food-labels). [Rancid before you taste it](/blog/pufas-inflammation).

**[Want omega-3s? Eat fatty fish](/blog/meal-planning).**

EPA and DHA from fish are pre-formed. [No conversion needed](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat). More stable than plant omega-3s.

## Whole Nuts vs. Nut Oils

**Whole nuts in moderation: fine.**

**Why:**
- PUFAs are inside the nut, protected by shell and skin
- [Less exposure to oxygen, heat, light](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress)
- [Eaten with protein, fiber, minerals](/blog/meal-planning)
- Small amounts (handful daily) don't cause problems

**Nut oils: problematic.**

**Why:**
- [PUFAs extracted and exposed](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress)
- [Oxidize immediately](/blog/pufas-inflammation)
- [Concentrated (100% fat vs. 50-70% in whole nuts)](/blog/reading-food-labels)
- [Easy to overconsume](/blog/cooking-basics)

**Example:**

**Eating 10 walnuts:**
- ~7g PUFA
- Protected by walnut structure
- [Eaten with other foods](/blog/meal-planning)
- Probably fine

**Cooking with 2 tablespoons walnut oil:**
- ~20g PUFA
- [Fully oxidized from heat](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress)
- [Suppresses metabolism](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- Problematic

**[Whole nuts ≠ nut oils](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge).**

## Which Nuts Are Lowest in PUFAs

**If eating whole nuts:**

**Best choices (lowest PUFA):**
- Macadamia nuts: 2% PUFA (mostly saturated fat)
- Hazelnuts: 10% PUFA
- Cashews: 8% PUFA
- Chestnuts: 15% PUFA

**Moderate:**
- Almonds: 25% PUFA
- Pistachios: 28% PUFA
- Pecans: 25% PUFA
- Peanuts: 32% PUFA (technically legume)

**Highest PUFA (limit or avoid):**
- Walnuts: 75% PUFA
- Sunflower seeds: 65% PUFA
- Pumpkin seeds: 50% PUFA
- Pine nuts: 45% PUFA

**[Stick to macadamias and hazelnuts if eating nuts regularly](/blog/meal-planning).**

[Limit high-PUFA nuts to small amounts](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge).

## Sesame Oil

**Toasted sesame oil:**
Used in Asian cooking. Strong flavor.

**PUFA content:** 42%

**Better than canola?** [Yes](/blog/reading-food-labels).

**Still problematic?** [Yes](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

**If using sesame oil:**
- Use sparingly (1 teaspoon for flavor)
- Add after cooking (don't heat)
- [Don't use as primary cooking fat](/blog/cooking-basics)

**Better alternative:**
[Coconut aminos for Asian flavor](/blog/meal-planning). [Butter or coconut oil for cooking](/blog/cooking-basics).

## What to Cook With Instead

**Best cooking fats:**

**Butter:**
- 3% PUFA
- [Stable at high heat](/blog/cooking-basics)
- Delicious flavor
- [Supports thyroid and metabolism](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)

**Ghee (clarified butter):**
- 3% PUFA
- Higher smoke point than butter
- [Lactose removed (good for dairy-sensitive)](/blog/pufas-gut-health)

**Coconut oil:**
- 2% PUFA
- Very stable
- [Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs)](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat)
- High smoke point

**Tallow, lard, duck fat:**
- 5-10% PUFA
- [Traditional fats humans ate for millennia](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat)
- [Delicious, nutritious](/blog/meal-planning)

**[Olive oil (sparingly):](/blog/olive-oil-truth)**
- 10% PUFA
- [Use raw on salads](/blog/cooking-basics)
- [Don't cook with high heat](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress)

## How to Replace Nut Oils

**Walnut oil on salad →** [Olive oil or butter melted over warm vegetables](/blog/meal-planning)

**Almond oil in baking →** [Melted butter or coconut oil](/blog/cooking-basics)

**Sesame oil in stir-fry →** [Butter or ghee for cooking, tiny amount sesame oil for flavor at end](/blog/cooking-basics)

**Flaxseed oil supplement →** [Fatty fish 2-3x per week](/blog/meal-planning) or [fish oil if needed](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat)

**Grapeseed oil for high-heat cooking →** [Ghee, tallow, or coconut oil](/blog/cooking-basics)

## What About Nut Butters

**Almond butter, cashew butter, etc.:**

**If ingredients = nuts + salt:** Probably fine in moderation.

**If ingredients = nuts + vegetable oil:** [Avoid](/blog/reading-food-labels).

[Many commercial nut butters contain added canola or soybean oil](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). [Read labels](/blog/reading-food-labels).

**Better:**
- Make your own (blend nuts in food processor)
- Buy brands with only nuts and salt
- [Limit high-PUFA nut butters (walnut, sunflower seed)](/blog/reading-food-labels)

## Timeline After Eliminating Nut Oils

## FAQ

**Q: Is walnut oil really that bad? It's expensive and "artisanal."**
A: [75% PUFA](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat). [Oxidizes rapidly](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress). [Suppresses metabolism like canola](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Price doesn't change chemistry.

**Q: I take flaxseed oil for omega-3s. Should I stop?**
A: Yes. [Flaxseed oil is highly unstable](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress). [ALA converts poorly to EPA/DHA](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat). [Eat fatty fish instead](/blog/meal-planning) or [use fish oil supplements](/blog/vitamin-d-metabolism).

**Q: Can I eat a handful of almonds or walnuts daily?**
A: [Almonds in moderation are fine](/blog/meal-planning). [Limit walnuts (75% PUFA)](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). [Macadamias are better choice](/blog/meal-planning).

**Q: What about sesame oil in small amounts?**
A: [If using 1 teaspoon for flavor, probably okay](/blog/cooking-basics). [But don't use as main cooking fat](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). [Add after cooking, not during](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress).

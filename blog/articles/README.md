---

### 8. Why Does Low Body Temperature Ruin Your Sleep?
**File:** `08-temperature-sleep.md`
**Cluster:** Sleep
**Keyword:** body temperature sleep quality
**Length:** ~950 words
**Analogy:** *Sleep is like a tide. Low metabolism means no tide.*

**Key Points:**

**File:** `09-pufas-vs-sugar-obesity.md`
**Cluster:** Sugar & Obesity Myth
**Keyword:** pufas sugar obesity
**Length:** ~1,150 words
**Analogy:** *Metabolism is a furnace. Sugar is kindling. PUFAs smother the flame.*

**Key Points:**
- PUFA consumption correlates with obesity better than sugar
- PUFAs suppress metabolic rate and cause insulin resistance
- Sugar supports thyroid when eaten with saturated fats
- The combo of sugar + seed oils is the problem

---

### 10. 7-Day PUFA Purge: What to Expect
**File:** `10-seven-day-pufa-purge.md`
**Cluster:** Experiments & Self-Tracking
**Keyword:** pufa elimination experiment
**Length:** ~1,150 words
**Analogy:** *Clearing contaminated fuel. First days rough, then engine runs clean.*

**Key Points:**
- Day-by-day protocol and expectations
- What to track (temperature, pulse, energy, symptoms)
- Days 1-3: purge symptoms (headache, fatigue)
- Days 6-7: improvement (warmer, more energy)

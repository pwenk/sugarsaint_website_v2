# How to Plan Simple, Metabolism-Boosting Meals

## TL;DR

Meal planning is simple. Each meal: protein + carb + fat + salt. Use butter and coconut oil. Avoid all seed oils. Eat 2-3 meals daily. No complicated recipes needed. Rotate 10-15 basic meals. Shop weekly for fresh ingredients. Cook at home. Metabolism improves.

You want to eat better.

But meal planning feels overwhelming. Macros. Calories. Recipes. Prep. Containers.

You tried meal prep Sundays. Made seven identical meals. Ate the same thing daily. Got bored. Quit.

Or you bought meal plans online. 47 ingredients per recipe. Took two hours to cook one meal. Gave up.

Meal planning doesn't need to be complicated.

*Meal planning is like packing a suitcase. You need basics: shirts, pants, shoes. Not 50 outfits. Same meals, rotated, work perfectly.*

1. **Protein** (meat, eggs, fish, dairy)

## Meal Timing

**Eat 2-3 meals daily.**

**3 meals (recommended for most):**

- Lunch: 12-2pm
- Dinner: 6-8pm

**2 meals (if not hungry for breakfast):**
- First meal: 11am-1pm
- Second meal: 6-8pm

**[Don't force intermittent fasting](/blog/intermittent-fasting).** Eat when hungry. [Support thyroid with adequate food](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

## How Much to Eat

**Don't count calories obsessively.**

[Eat to satiety](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). [Your body regulates appetite when metabolism is healthy](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism).

**General guidelines:**

**Protein per meal:**
- 30-50g (palm-sized portion of meat, or 3-4 eggs)

**Carbs per meal:**
- 50-100g (medium potato, 1 cup cooked rice, or 2 pieces fruit)

**Fat:**
- [1-2 tablespoons butter per meal](/blog/cooking-basics)
- Natural fat in meat and dairy

**[Salt liberally](/blog/electrolytes-salt).**

**If you're cold, tired, or losing weight unintentionally:**
[Eat more](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). [Increase carbs first](/blog/low-carb-thyroid).

## What About Snacks

**Ideally, no snacks.**

3 meals should satisfy you. If not, meals are too small.

**If you need snacks:**
- Fruit + cheese
- Yogurt + honey
- [Hard-boiled eggs](/blog/cooking-basics)
- Milk
- Fruit smoothie (milk, banana, berries)

**Avoid:**
- Packaged snacks (contain seed oils)
- Protein bars (seed oils)
- Trail mix (seed oils in roasted nuts)
- [Chips, crackers](/blog/reading-food-labels) (all seed oils)

## Eating Out Strategy

**[Limit to 1-2 restaurant meals weekly](/blog/restaurant-pufa-guide).**

**When eating out:**
- [Steakhouse: steak + potato + salad](/blog/restaurant-pufa-guide)
- [Sushi: sashimi + white rice](/blog/restaurant-pufa-guide)
- [Breakfast: eggs + hash browns](/blog/restaurant-pufa-guide)

[Every restaurant uses seed oils](/blog/restaurant-pufa-guide). Minimize frequency. [Cook at home as much as possible](/blog/cooking-basics).

## Prep Strategies

**Sunday prep (optional):**
- [Hard-boil eggs](/blog/cooking-basics) (snacks for week)
- [Cook large pot of rice](/blog/cooking-basics) (lasts 5 days in fridge)
- Make beef stew (dinner + leftovers)

**No-prep approach:**
[Cook fresh each meal](/blog/cooking-basics). Takes 20-30 minutes. Tastes better than reheated food.

**Choose what works for you.** Both are fine.

## Common Mistakes

**Not eating enough:**
[Undereating suppresses thyroid](/blog/intermittent-fasting). [Eat adequate calories](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). [Track temperature](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). Should be 98°F+.

**Making it too complicated:**
Simple meals work. Meat + starch + vegetable + butter. Repeat. Don't need fancy recipes.

**Skipping carbs:**
[Thyroid needs glucose](/blog/low-carb-thyroid). Include carbs at every meal.

**Using "healthy" oils:**
[Avocado oil is still a PUFA](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat). [Use butter and coconut oil only](/blog/cooking-basics).

**Not salting enough:**
[Your body needs sodium](/blog/electrolytes-salt). Salt until food tastes good.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to track macros?**
A: No. [Eat protein + carb + fat at each meal](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). [Listen to appetite](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). [Track temperature instead](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism).

**Q: Can I eat the same thing every day?**
A: Yes, if you want. Many people eat [eggs and potatoes every breakfast](/blog/cooking-basics). Gets boring for some. Rotate meals if preferred.

**Q: What if I don't like cooking?**
A: [Basic cooking is simple](/blog/cooking-basics). Pan-fry, bake, boil. Three methods. You can learn in one week. [Eating out daily will keep you sick](/blog/restaurant-pufa-guide).

**Q: How much does this cost?**
A: $50-100/week for one person. [Eating out costs more and destroys your health](/blog/restaurant-pufa-guide). Home cooking is cheaper and better.

# How Does Metabolism Affect Teeth and Gum Health?

## TL;DR

Healthy teeth need good metabolism. Low thyroid reduces saliva production (dry mouth, cavities). Inflammation from PUFAs causes gum disease. Adequate vitamins A, D, K2 support tooth structure. Eliminate PUFAs, support thyroid, eat nutrient-dense food. Dental health improves.

Your teeth are sensitive.

Your gums bleed when you brush. You have cavities every year despite flossing.

Your dentist says you're not brushing enough. Need more fluoride. Maybe genetic.

But your grandparents had their teeth until they died. What changed?

[Your metabolism](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

*Teeth are like bones in your mouth. They need the same nutrients. Same metabolic support. PUFAs starve them.*

## What Healthy Teeth Need

**Strong enamel:**
- Calcium and phosphorus
- Adequate saliva (remineralization)
- pH balance

**Healthy gums:**
- Low inflammation
- Good circulation
- Intact connective tissue

**[All of this requires good metabolism](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).**

## Low Thyroid and Dry Mouth

[Low thyroid reduces saliva production](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation).

**Saliva does:**
- Buffers acid (protects enamel)
- Remineralizes teeth (repairs early cavities)
- Clears food particles
- Contains antibacterial compounds

**Without enough saliva:**
- Enamel demineralizes
- Cavities form faster
- Gums recede
- Bad breath

[Fix thyroid](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Saliva production improves. Teeth strengthen.

## PUFAs and Gum Disease

Gum disease is inflammation.

[PUFAs cause systemic inflammation](/blog/pufas-inflammation). This shows up in gums.

**Gingivitis (early stage):**
- Gums bleed when brushing
- Red, swollen gums
- Mild discomfort

**Periodontitis (advanced):**
- Gum recession
- Bone loss
- Loose teeth
- Severe infection

[Eliminate PUFAs](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). Gum inflammation reduces. Bleeding stops.

## Vitamins for Teeth

**Vitamin A:**
- Supports enamel formation
- Needed for saliva production
- From liver, egg yolks, butter

**Vitamin D:**
- Helps absorb calcium
- Supports immune function (fights infection)
- From sun or supplements

**Vitamin K2:**
- Directs calcium to teeth and bones (not soft tissues)
- From natto, grass-fed dairy, egg yolks

**These vitamins are fat-soluble.**

[You need saturated fat to absorb them](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat). PUFAs impair absorption.

## The Calcium Question

**Teeth need calcium.** But not from supplements.

**Food sources:**
- Dairy (milk, cheese, yogurt)
- Bone-in fish (sardines)
- Bone broth

**[Better absorption when:](/blog/calcium-vitamin-d)**
- [Gut is healthy](/blog/pufas-gut-health)
- Vitamin D is adequate
- [Thyroid function is normal](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)

## How to Improve Dental Health

**[Eliminate PUFAs](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge).**

**[Eat nutrient-dense food:](/blog/meal-planning)**
- Liver (vitamin A)
- Egg yolks (K2, A, D)
- Grass-fed butter or ghee (K2)
- Dairy (calcium)
- Fish (vitamin D, calcium)

**[Support thyroid:](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)**
- Adequate carbs
- Iodine
- [Track temperature](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)

**Basic dental care:**
- Brush twice daily
- Floss (removes food between teeth)
- Don't overbrush (damages enamel)

Most people notice:
- Week 4-8: Less bleeding gums
- Month 3-6: Reduced sensitivity
- Month 6-12: Fewer cavities at next checkup

## What About Fluoride

Fluoride strengthens enamel. It works.

**Controversies:**
- Systemic fluoride (water, supplements) vs topical (toothpaste)
- Potential thyroid suppression at high doses
- Fluorosis (cosmetic enamel damage)

**Our take:**
- Topical fluoride (toothpaste) is fine for most people
- Systemic fluoride (fluoridated water) is debated—make your own decision
- [Fix metabolism first](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Strong metabolism = strong teeth even without fluoride

## FAQ

**Q: Will better metabolism reverse cavities?**
A: Early cavities can remineralize with good saliva flow. Deep cavities need filling. But future cavity risk drops as metabolism improves.

**Q: My dentist says I grind my teeth at night. Related to metabolism?**
A: [Teeth grinding often relates to stress and poor sleep](/blog/body-temperature-sleep). [Fix sleep through metabolic optimization](/blog/anxiety-pufas). Grinding often reduces.

**Q: What about oil pulling?**
A: Some people find it helpful for gum health. Use coconut oil (antimicrobial). But it's not a replacement for fixing metabolism.

**Q: Can diet really prevent cavities?**
A: Yes. Traditional populations with nutrient-dense diets and [no seed oils](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat) had excellent dental health despite no brushing. Modern cavities are metabolic disease.

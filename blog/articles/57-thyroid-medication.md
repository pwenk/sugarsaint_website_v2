# Do You Need Thyroid Medication? A Practical Guide

## TL;DR

Thyroid medication treats symptoms, not root cause. Levothyroxine (T4) doesn't work if conversion is broken. T3 medication may help if PUFAs block conversion. But medication alone won't fix metabolism. Eliminate PUFAs first. Support thyroid naturally. Medication is a tool, not a solution. Work with your doctor.

Your thyroid labs came back abnormal.

TSH is high. T4 is low. Your doctor prescribed levothyroxine. "Take this every morning. Forever."

You took it. For months. Maybe years.

Some symptoms improved. Many didn't. [Still tired](/blog/energy-crashes). [Still cold](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). [Still can't lose weight](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

Your doctor raised your dose. Then raised it again. Labs normalized. Symptoms didn't.

Medication isn't fixing the root cause.

*Thyroid medication is like giving your car more fuel when the engine is broken. The fuel helps. But the engine still doesn't run right.*

## Types of Thyroid Medication

**Levothyroxine (Synthroid, Levoxyl, Tirosint):**
- Synthetic T4 (inactive thyroid hormone)
- Your body must convert T4 to T3 (active form)
- [Most common prescription](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation)

**Liothyronine (Cytomel):**
- Synthetic T3 (active form)
- Doesn't require conversion
- Shorter half-life (need multiple daily doses)

**Natural Desiccated Thyroid (Armour, Nature-Throid, NP Thyroid):**
- Porcine (pig) thyroid gland
- Contains T4, T3, T2, T1, calcitonin
- Ratio: ~4:1 T4:T3

**Compounded T4/T3:**
- Custom ratios from compounding pharmacy
- Flexible dosing

## When Thyroid Medication Helps

**Legitimate hypothyroidism:**
- Hashimoto's (autoimmune destruction of thyroid)
- Post-surgical (thyroid removed)
- Radioactive iodine treatment
- Congenital (born without functional thyroid)

**In these cases, medication is necessary.** Your thyroid can't produce enough hormone.

**But most people with "hypothyroid" symptoms:**
- Have normal or borderline labs
- Have [conversion problems (T4 doesn't become T3)](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- Have [PUFA-induced thyroid suppression](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- Need metabolic fixes, not more medication

## Why Levothyroxine Often Doesn't Work

**You take T4. Your body needs T3.**

[Conversion requires:](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- Functioning liver and kidneys
- Adequate selenium
- Low cortisol
- Low inflammation
- Healthy gut

**[PUFAs block conversion.](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)**

You can take all the levothyroxine in the world. If [PUFAs suppress conversion](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid), your cells don't get T3.

**Your labs look fine:**
- TSH normalized (medication suppresses TSH)
- T4 is high (you're taking synthetic T4)
- T3 stays low (conversion is blocked)
- Reverse T3 is high (T4 converts to inactive form instead)

**You still feel terrible.** Because cells need T3, not T4.

## When T3 Medication Helps

**If conversion is broken, T3 bypasses the problem.**

**T3 (Cytomel) or NDT (Armour):**
- Provides active hormone directly
- [Temperature rises](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- [Energy improves](/blog/energy-crashes)
- Symptoms reduce

**But this is still a bandaid.**

[PUFAs are still suppressing your natural thyroid function](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). [Inflammation is still high](/blog/pufas-inflammation). [Mitochondria are still damaged](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress).

**You need medication PLUS metabolic fixing.**

## The Better Approach

**Work with your doctor. Don't stop medication without guidance.**

**Then fix the root cause:**

**[Eliminate all PUFAs:](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge)**
- [Cook with butter, coconut oil, ghee](/blog/cooking-basics)
- [Avoid all seed oils](/blog/reading-food-labels)
- [Minimize restaurant meals](/blog/restaurant-pufa-guide)

**[Support thyroid naturally:](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)**
- Adequate carbs (150-250g daily)
- Iodine from seafood or iodized salt
- Selenium from Brazil nuts (2-3 daily) or meat
- [Track temperature](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)

**[Reduce metabolic stressors:](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism)**
- [Don't overtrain](/blog/exercise-metabolism)
- [Don't undereat](/blog/intermittent-fasting)
- [Prioritize sleep](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)

**Monitor symptoms and labs:**
- [Temperature trending up](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- [Energy improving](/blog/energy-crashes)
- TSH, Free T3, Free T4, Reverse T3 every 3-6 months

**Many people reduce or eliminate medication** as metabolism heals. Work with your doctor.

## How to Work with Your Doctor

**If your doctor prescribes levothyroxine:**
- Ask about adding T3 if symptoms persist
- Request Free T3 and Reverse T3 testing
- [Explain symptoms despite "normal" labs](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation)

**If your doctor dismisses you:**
- Find a functional medicine practitioner
- Find an integrative doctor
- Look for doctors who prescribe NDT or T3

**Red flags (find new doctor):**
- Only tests TSH
- Refuses to test Free T3 or Reverse T3
- Says T3 medication is "dangerous"
- Dismisses symptoms when labs are "normal"

**Green flags (good doctor):**
- Tests full thyroid panel
- Listens to symptoms, not just labs
- Willing to try T3 or NDT
- Supports metabolic optimization alongside medication

## Risks of Thyroid Medication

**Overmedication (too much):**
- [Heart palpitations](/blog/pulse-tracking-guide)
- [Anxiety](/blog/anxiety-pufas)
- Insomnia
- Weight loss despite eating
- [High pulse](/blog/pulse-tracking-guide)

**Long-term high doses:**
- Bone loss (osteoporosis)
- Atrial fibrillation (heart rhythm disorder)

**Undermedication (too little):**
- Symptoms persist
- No improvement in quality of life

**This is why monitoring matters.** Work with your doctor. Test regularly.

## Natural Thyroid Support (No Medication)

**If labs are borderline and doctor won't prescribe:**

**[Optimize diet:](/blog/meal-planning)**
- [Adequate carbs, protein, saturated fats](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat)
- [Eliminate all PUFAs](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge)
- [Iodine-rich foods](/blog/electrolytes-salt)

**Supplements (if deficient):**
- Iodine (if low on labs, start 150-300mcg daily)
- Selenium (200mcg daily, or 2-3 Brazil nuts)
- [Magnesium glycinate](/blog/electrolytes-salt) (supports conversion)

**[Track symptoms:](/blog/tracking-symptoms)**
- [Temperature daily](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- [Pulse at rest](/blog/pulse-tracking-guide)
- [Energy, sleep, mood](/blog/anxiety-pufas)

**Retest labs in 3-6 months.**

Many people see improvement without medication once [PUFAs are eliminated](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge).

## FAQ

**Q: Can I stop taking levothyroxine?**
A: Never stop without doctor supervision. If thyroid is destroyed (Hashimoto's, surgery), you need medication. If thyroid function returns with metabolic optimization, doctor can taper dose. Don't do this alone.

**Q: Is natural desiccated thyroid better than Synthroid?**
A: For some people, yes. NDT contains T3, which bypasses conversion problems. But it's not magic. [Fix metabolism alongside medication](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

**Q: My doctor won't prescribe T3. What do I do?**
A: Find a new doctor. Functional medicine or integrative practitioners are more likely to prescribe T3 or NDT.

**Q: Will thyroid medication help me lose weight?**
A: If thyroid is truly low and medication optimizes levels, metabolism improves. Weight loss becomes easier. But medication alone won't cause weight loss if [diet is still full of PUFAs](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge).

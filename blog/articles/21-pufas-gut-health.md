# How Do PUFAs Affect Gut Health and Digestion?

## TL;DR

PUFAs oxidize in your gut and damage the intestinal lining. This creates leaky gut, inflammation, and dysbiosis. You get bloating, irregular bowel movements, food sensitivities, and poor nutrient absorption. Saturated fats heal the gut lining. Most people see digestion improve within 4-6 weeks of eliminating seed oils.

Your digestion is a mess.

Bloating after every meal. Constipation for days. Then diarrhea. Nothing is regular.

You cut gluten. Dairy. FODMAPs. Still bloated.

You take probiotics. Digestive enzymes. Fiber supplements. Nothing helps.

The seed oils in every meal are destroying your gut lining.

*Your gut lining is like a screen door. PUFAs rust the mesh until everything gets through.*

## What PUFAs Do to Your Gut

**They damage the intestinal lining.** Your gut lining is one cell thick. It absorbs nutrients but blocks toxins and bacteria. When PUFAs oxidize, they create compounds that damage these cells. The barrier breaks down.

**They create leaky gut.** Damaged cells don't seal properly. Gaps form between cells. Undigested food particles, bacteria, and toxins leak into your bloodstream. Your immune system attacks them. [Inflammation becomes chronic](/blog/pufas-inflammation).

**They disrupt the microbiome.** Good bacteria need specific conditions. PUFAs change the gut environment. Beneficial bacteria die off. Harmful bacteria overgrow. This is dysbiosis.

**They impair bile production.** [PUFAs suppress thyroid function](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Low thyroid means sluggish liver and gallbladder. You don't make enough bile to digest fats properly.

**They reduce stomach acid.** Low metabolism means low stomach acid production. Food doesn't break down fully. You get bloating, gas, and incomplete digestion.

## What You Notice

**Bloating after meals.** Your stomach distends. Feels tight. Uncomfortable. Sometimes painful.

**Irregular bowel movements.** Constipation for 3-4 days. Then loose stools. No pattern. Never "normal."

**Food sensitivities.** You react to foods you used to tolerate. Dairy gives you gas. Eggs upset your stomach. Vegetables make you bloat.

**Undigested food in stool.** You see recognizable food pieces. This means poor digestion and absorption.

**Acid reflux or heartburn.** Paradoxically caused by LOW stomach acid, not high. Food sits in stomach too long.

**Fatigue after eating.** Instead of energy, you feel tired. Your body is fighting inflammation from leaky gut.

**Skin issues.** Acne, eczema, rashes. Your gut and skin are connected. Gut inflammation shows on your face.

## The Leaky Gut Connection

Leaky gut isn't pseudoscience. It's called "increased intestinal permeability" in medical literature.

**What happens:**
1. PUFAs damage tight junctions between intestinal cells
2. Gaps form in the gut lining
3. Large molecules leak through (undigested proteins, bacteria, toxins)
4. Your immune system detects foreign invaders
5. It releases inflammatory cytokines
6. You get systemic inflammation and food reactions

This explains why you suddenly react to foods you've eaten your whole life. Your immune system is seeing partially digested food proteins in your bloodstream and attacking them.

## How to Heal Your Gut

**Eliminate seed oils immediately.** Stop the damage. [No canola, soybean, sunflower, safflower, corn oil](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). Cook with butter, coconut oil, ghee.

**Eat saturated fats.** Butter contains butyrate, which feeds gut cells. Coconut oil has antimicrobial properties that rebalance the microbiome. Animal fats provide fat-soluble vitamins needed for gut repair.

**Support stomach acid.** Don't take antacids unless absolutely necessary. Consider digestive bitters before meals. Some people benefit from betaine HCl supplements (work with a practitioner).

**Eat enough protein.** Your gut lining turns over every 3-5 days. You need amino acids to rebuild cells. Meat, eggs, dairy, fish.

**Support bile production.** [Fix thyroid function by eliminating PUFAs and eating carbs](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Consider ox bile supplements if you've had your gallbladder removed.

**Eat easy-to-digest foods initially.** White rice, well-cooked potatoes, ripe fruit, ground meat, bone broth. Save raw vegetables and tough cuts of meat for later.

**Consider gelatin/collagen.** Glycine in gelatin helps repair gut lining. Bone broth or gelatin powder in juice or smoothies.

**Reduce stress.** Stress diverts blood flow from digestion. It also increases gut permeability. [Poor sleep worsens gut health](/blog/body-temperature-sleep).

Most people notice improvements within 4-6 weeks:
- Less bloating after meals
- More regular bowel movements
- Reduced food sensitivities
- Better energy after eating
- Clearer skin

Full gut healing takes 3-6 months as the lining completely rebuilds.

## What About Probiotics

Probiotics can help but they don't fix the root cause.

If you're still eating PUFAs, you're continuously damaging your gut. Adding probiotics is like planting flowers in toxic soil.

**Eliminate PUFAs first.** Then add probiotics if needed.

**Food sources are better:** Plain yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi. These come with prebiotics (fiber) that feed the bacteria.

**Supplement quality matters:** Most shelf-stable probiotics have dead bacteria. Refrigerated brands are better. Look for multiple strains and high CFU count (50+ billion).

But honestly, most people don't need probiotics once they fix their diet. The gut microbiome rebalances naturally when you stop poisoning it.

## The SIBO Connection

Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) is when bacteria overgrow in your small intestine.

**Symptoms:**
- Severe bloating within 30-60 minutes of eating
- Gas that smells terrible
- Alternating constipation and diarrhea
- Extreme food sensitivities

**Causes:**
- Low stomach acid (can't kill incoming bacteria)
- Slow gut motility (bacteria have time to colonize)
- [Low thyroid function from PUFAs causes both](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)

SIBO requires specific treatment (antibiotics, herbal antimicrobials, or elemental diet). But fixing metabolism helps prevent recurrence.

## FAQ

**Q: Will eliminating PUFAs cure my IBS?**
A: IBS is a symptom cluster, not a root cause diagnosis. Many people find IBS symptoms resolve when they eliminate PUFAs and heal their gut. Others need additional interventions (SIBO treatment, parasite testing, stress management).

**Q: Can I eat fiber while healing my gut?**
A: Depends on your current state. Raw vegetables and whole grains can irritate a damaged gut lining. Start with low-fiber, easy-to-digest foods. Add fiber gradually as you heal. Well-cooked vegetables and fruit are usually well-tolerated.

**Q: How do I know if I have leaky gut?**
A: No perfect test exists. The lactulose-mannitol test measures intestinal permeability but isn't widely available. Better to track symptoms: do you have food sensitivities, chronic inflammation, autoimmune conditions, skin issues, brain fog? These suggest leaky gut. Test by elimination: remove PUFAs and track improvement.

**Q: Should I do an elimination diet?**
A: Eliminating PUFAs is more important than eliminating food groups. Many "food sensitivities" resolve when gut heals. If you still react after 6 months of PUFA elimination, then investigate specific foods. But start with the oils.

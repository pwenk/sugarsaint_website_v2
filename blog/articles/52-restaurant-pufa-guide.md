# How to Eat at Restaurants Without Seed Oils

## TL;DR

Every restaurant uses seed oils. Every dish. Every sauce. Every "healthy" option. Avoid fried foods, ask for butter instead of oil, choose simple grilled items, bring your own dressing. Or just accept that restaurant meals will contain PUFAs and minimize frequency. Home cooking is the real solution.

You want to eat out.

Date night. Business lunch. Celebration dinner. Travel.

You open the menu. Everything looks fine. Grilled chicken. Salmon. Salad.

Then you remember. The kitchen cooks everything in vegetable oil. The salad dressing is soybean oil. The "grilled" fish sits in a pool of canola.

You're paying $30 for thyroid suppression.

*Eating out is like smoking at a restaurant. Even the "non-smoking section" reeks of smoke. You're still getting exposed.*

## The Restaurant Problem

**Every restaurant uses seed oils.**

Why:
- Cheap (gallons cost less than pounds of butter)
- High smoke point (can cook hotter without burning)
- Industry standard (every chef trained with them)
- Long shelf life (butter goes rancid faster)

**Even "healthy" restaurants:**
- Farm-to-table: cooks vegetables in sunflower oil
- Mediterranean: uses "olive oil" (actually canola blend)
- Vegan: deep-fries in soybean oil
- Paleo: makes mayo with avocado oil (still a PUFA)

[You cannot escape seed oils in restaurants](/blog/reading-food-labels). Accept this reality.

## Safest Restaurant Choices

**Steakhouses:**
- Order steak (specify no oil on the grill)
- Ask for butter instead of oil
- Baked potato with butter and sour cream
- Simple salad with olive oil and vinegar

**Sushi restaurants:**
- Sashimi (raw fish, no rice)
- Avoid tempura (fried in seed oil)
- Avoid spicy mayo (soybean oil)
- [White rice with fish is fine](/blog/meal-planning)

**Brazilian steakhouses:**
- All-you-can-eat meat
- Usually grilled over open flame (minimal oil)
- Avoid fried items (fried cheese, plantains)

**Breakfast diners:**
- Eggs (ask for butter)
- Bacon or sausage
- Hash browns (if cooked in butter—ask)
- Fruit

**Mediterranean:**
- Lamb or chicken kebabs
- [Rice pilaf](/blog/meal-planning)
- Ask for olive oil (might be blend, but better than fryer oil)

## What to Avoid Completely

**Fried foods:**
Everything fried is cooked in seed oil. French fries, fried chicken, tempura, fried fish, onion rings, chips.

**Sauces and dressings:**
- Ranch (soybean oil)
- Caesar (canola oil)
- Vinaigrette (usually canola with vinegar)
- Aioli (vegetable oil)
- Teriyaki (contains soybean oil)
- Any creamy sauce

**Bread and baked goods:**
Restaurant bread contains soybean oil. Rolls, biscuits, cornbread. All have seed oils in the dough.

**Stir-fries and sautéed dishes:**
Cooked in vegetable oil at high heat. Even "healthy" vegetable stir-fries.

**"Grilled" items:**
Most restaurants oil the grill or brush food with oil before grilling. Ask them not to.

## How to Order

**Be specific:**
"Can you cook this in butter instead of oil?"
"Can you grill this without brushing it with oil?"
"Can I get olive oil and vinegar instead of dressing?"

**Expect confusion:**
Most servers won't understand. They'll say "we use vegetable oil" like it's a good thing.

**Be prepared to send food back:**
If your steak arrives swimming in oil, send it back. You're paying. They can remake it.

**Bring your own:**
- Small container of olive oil for salads
- Your own dressing in a travel bottle
- Salt and pepper if you're particular

**Or just simplify:**
Plain grilled meat. Plain baked potato. Side salad with olive oil. Boring but safe.

## Best Cuisines for Avoiding PUFAs

**Ranked from best to worst:**

1. **Steakhouses** - Simple preparations, butter available
2. **Brazilian/Churrascarias** - Grilled meat, minimal oil
3. **Sushi/Sashimi bars** - Raw fish is safe
4. **Traditional American diners** - Can request butter
5. **Mediterranean (carefully)** - Lamb, kebabs, simple preparations
6. **Indian** - [Ghee-based cooking](/blog/cooking-basics) (if authentic)
7. **Italian** - Pasta exists, but sauces contain seed oils
8. **Mexican** - Everything fried in vegetable oil
9. **Chinese** - Stir-fries in vegetable oil, high heat
10. **Thai** - Deep-fried apps, curries with seed oils
11. **American casual** - Fried everything, seed oil sauces

## Fast Food Strategy

**You're traveling. You're stuck. You need fast food.**

**Least-bad options:**

**McDonald's:**
- Plain hamburger (ask for no sauce)
- Avoid fries (fried in seed oil)
- Apple slices

**Chipotle:**
- [Carnitas or chicken](/blog/meal-planning)
- [White rice](/blog/meal-planning)
- Salsa, cheese, sour cream
- Skip guacamole (if made with canola oil)

**Five Guys:**
- Burger with cheese (hold the mayo)
- Lettuce wrap if very strict
- Skip fries

**Chick-fil-A:**
- Grilled chicken sandwich (not fried)
- Hold the sauce
- Fruit cup

**In-N-Out:**
- Burger protein-style (lettuce wrap)
- Or regular bun (less seed oil than fries)

**None of these are ideal.** [All contain some seed oils](/blog/reading-food-labels). But when you're stuck, minimize damage.

## What About "Healthy" Oil Claims

**"We use avocado oil":**
[Avocado oil is still a PUFA](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat). Better than soybean oil. Still not butter.

**"We use olive oil":**
Most restaurants don't. They use canola and call it "olive oil blend." Even real olive oil oxidizes at cooking temperatures.

**"We use coconut oil":**
Great if true. Rare in restaurants (expensive). Ask to confirm.

**"We don't use seed oils":**
Verify. Ask what oils they use. Check ingredients in sauces and dressings.

## The Reality Check

**Eating out = eating seed oils.**

You can minimize exposure. You can make better choices. But you cannot eliminate PUFAs in restaurants.

**Your options:**
1. [Cook at home 90% of the time](/blog/cooking-basics)
2. Eat out rarely (special occasions)
3. Choose safest restaurants (steakhouses, sushi)
4. Be very specific when ordering
5. Accept imperfection

[Most people notice better results by limiting restaurant meals to 1-2 per week](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge).

## FAQ

**Q: Can I eat out at all?**
A: Yes. Occasionally. But not daily. [The more you eat out, the harder it is to optimize metabolism](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

**Q: What if I have to eat out for work?**
A: Choose wisest options available. Steakhouse. Simple grilled items. Skip sauces. Do your best. Then [eat clean at home](/blog/meal-planning).

**Q: What about olive oil at restaurants?**
A: If they give you a bottle of olive oil for bread/salad, that's usually real olive oil. Cooking oil in the kitchen is almost always canola or soybean, regardless of what the menu says.

**Q: How do I handle social situations?**
A: [Eat before you go](/blog/meal-planning). Order simple items. Don't make a scene. One meal won't destroy your metabolism. Consistent home cooking matters more than perfect restaurant navigation.

# How Do PUFAs Affect Women's Hormones?

## TL;DR

PUFAs increase estrogen and lower progesterone. They're stored in fat tissue and slowly release estrogen-like compounds. They suppress thyroid which lowers progesterone production. High estrogen and low progesterone mean heavy periods, PMS, breast tenderness, weight gain around hips. Swap seed oils for saturated fats. Most women notice lighter periods and less PMS within 2-3 cycles.

Your period used to be four days. Now it's seven.

Heavy flow. Clots. Cramping. PMS that starts a week before you bleed.

Your breasts are tender for two weeks out of every month.

You gain weight even when you eat less.

Your doctor offers birth control. You want to fix the problem, not mask it.

*Your hormones are a seesaw. Estrogen and progesterone balance each other. PUFAs tip the seesaw toward estrogen. Everything gets heavier on that side.*

## How PUFAs Increase Estrogen

PUFAs are stored in body fat. Your fat tissue isn't inert storage. It's metabolically active. It produces hormones.

PUFA-rich fat tissue produces more estrogen. The oxidized breakdown products of PUFAs mimic estrogen. They bind to estrogen receptors. Your body thinks it has more estrogen than it does.

Real estrogen plus fake estrogen equals estrogen dominance.

PUFAs also suppress an enzyme called aromatase in the right way. Wait, no. They increase aromatase activity. Aromatase converts testosterone to estrogen. More aromatase means more estrogen production.

Higher estrogen. Lower testosterone. You feel the shift.

## How PUFAs Lower Progesterone

Progesterone needs thyroid hormone to be produced. Your ovaries make progesterone after ovulation. But they need good thyroid function to do it.

PUFAs suppress thyroid at the cellular level. Lower thyroid means lower progesterone.

Progesterone balances estrogen. It calms the nervous system. It promotes sleep. It reduces inflammation. It builds bone. It protects against breast cancer.

Without enough progesterone, estrogen runs wild.

Heavy periods. Clots. Painful cramping. PMS. Mood swings. Anxiety. Insomnia. Breast tenderness. Fibroids. Endometriosis.

These are symptoms of estrogen dominance. Not enough progesterone to balance the estrogen.

## What You Notice

**Heavy periods.** More flow. More days. Clots. You soak through tampons.

**Long cycles.** Instead of 28 days, you go 35 or 40 days between periods. Ovulation is delayed. Progesterone production is low.

**PMS that lasts forever.** Irritability, bloating, breast pain starting 7-10 days before your period.

**Weight gain around hips and thighs.** Estrogen promotes fat storage in these areas. You can't lose it even with diet and exercise.

**Low libido.** High estrogen and low testosterone means low sex drive.

**Anxiety and poor sleep.** Progesterone is calming. Without it, you're wired and tired.

**Breast tenderness.** Estrogen makes breast tissue swell. Progesterone reduces swelling. Dominance means constant tenderness.

## What You Do

Stop eating seed oils. Your fat tissue will slowly clear stored PUFAs. As PUFAs decrease, estrogen production normalizes.

This takes time. If you've been eating vegetable oil for twenty years, you have years of PUFAs stored in fat. But you'll notice improvement within a few cycles.

Eat saturated fats. Butter. Coconut oil. Ghee. These don't produce estrogen-like byproducts. They support healthy hormone production.

Eat enough carbohydrates. Glucose supports thyroid function. Better thyroid means better progesterone production after ovulation.

Track your cycle. Note period length, flow, PMS symptoms. After two to three cycles on saturated fats, compare. Most women see lighter flow, shorter periods, less PMS.

Consider progesterone supplementation if symptoms are severe. Bioidentical progesterone cream or oral micronized progesterone can help while you're clearing PUFAs. Work with a doctor who understands hormones.

Support liver detox. Your liver breaks down excess estrogen. Eat enough protein. Get enough sleep. Avoid alcohol. Your liver needs resources to process hormones.

## FAQ

**Q: Will eliminating PUFAs fix my PCOS?**
A: It helps. PCOS involves insulin resistance and hormone imbalance. Removing PUFAs improves insulin sensitivity and lowers inflammation. It won't cure PCOS alone, but it's a good foundation.

**Q: I'm on birth control. Should I still eliminate seed oils?**
A: Yes. Birth control doesn't fix the underlying problem. It suppresses your natural cycle. Cleaning up your diet helps when you eventually come off birth control.

**Q: How long until my periods get lighter?**
A: Most women notice changes within 2-3 cycles. Some see improvement in the first cycle. Your fat tissue is slowly clearing PUFAs. The longer you've been eating seed oils, the longer it takes to clear.

**Q: Can PUFAs cause endometriosis or fibroids?**
A: They don't directly cause them. But estrogen dominance feeds these conditions. Lowering estrogen by eliminating PUFAs can slow their growth. It's not a cure but it helps.

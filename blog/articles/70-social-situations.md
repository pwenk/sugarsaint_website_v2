# How to Navigate Social Situations While Avoiding Seed Oils

## TL;DR

Social eating is hard when avoiding seed oils. Don't preach. Don't explain unless asked. Eat before events. Order simple items at restaurants. Bring your own food to potlucks. Host more. One meal won't destroy you. Consistency at home matters more than perfection at parties. Keep it simple.

---

You're invited to dinner.

Friend's house. Family gathering. Work event. Birthday party.

You know the food will be cooked in vegetable oil. Processed snacks. [Restaurant catering](/blog/restaurant-pufa-guide).

You want to go. You also want to maintain your health.

Do you skip it? Eat beforehand? Make excuses? Bring your own food?

You don't want to be "that person." But you also don't want to feel terrible.

*Social eating is like navigating a minefield. One wrong step won't kill you. But you'd prefer to avoid them all.*

## The Golden Rule: Don't Preach

**Nobody wants a lecture at dinner.**

[You know seed oils are harmful](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). [They don't](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat). [Yet](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge).

**Don't:**
- Explain PUFAs at the dinner table
- Criticize the food
- Tell people what they should eat
- Make others feel bad

**Do:**
- Make your own choices quietly
- Answer questions briefly if asked
- Change subject quickly
- [Focus on connection, not food](/blog/anxiety-pufas)

**You're not the food police.**

## Strategies for Different Situations

### **Restaurants with Friends**

**[Order strategically:](/blog/restaurant-pufa-guide)**
- Steak + baked potato + salad
- Grilled fish (ask for no oil)
- Burger (skip fries)
- [Simple breakfast items](/blog/restaurant-pufa-guide)

**Say nothing unless asked:**
Friend: "Why no fries?"
You: "Just not in the mood."

**That's it.** No explanation needed.

**If pressed:**
"I feel better when I don't eat fried food."

**Don't elaborate.** They don't care about your thyroid.

### **Dinner at Someone's House**

**Options:**

**1. Eat beforehand**
- [Full meal at home](/blog/meal-planning)
- Eat small portions at dinner (social, not nutritional)
- Focus on conversation

**2. Bring a dish**
- "[Made this to share](/blog/cooking-basics)"
- Ensure at least one safe option
- Eat mostly what you brought

**3. Choose safest options available**
- Plain meat (if not drowned in sauce)
- Plain vegetables
- Salad (skip dressing or bring your own)
- Fruit

**Don't:**
- Interrogate host about ingredients
- Refuse everything
- Make a scene

**One meal won't destroy you.** [Your daily choices matter more](/blog/tracking-symptoms).

### **Potlucks and Parties**

**Bring abundant food you can eat:**
- [Deviled eggs](/blog/cooking-basics)
- [Meatballs](/blog/meal-planning)
- [Vegetable tray with homemade dip](/blog/reading-food-labels)
- [Fruit tray](/blog/meal-planning)
- [Cheese board](/blog/meal-planning)

**Eat mostly what you brought.**

Others will eat it too. You'll have options. No one notices.

### **Work Events**

**Catered lunch meetings:**
- Choose safest options (plain protein, fruit)
- Skip obviously fried items
- [Eat real meal before or after](/blog/meal-planning)

**Office birthday cake:**
- "Thanks, I'm good."
- No explanation needed
- If pressed: "Already ate" or "Too full"

**Don't make it about health.** [Make it about preference](/blog/children-pufas).

### **Family Holidays**

**Hardest scenario.** Family has opinions.

**Strategies:**

**1. Offer to cook**
- "I'll bring the turkey"
- [Cook main dishes in butter](/blog/cooking-basics)
- [Control major food items](/blog/meal-planning)

**2. Focus on safe items**
- Plain turkey (if not injected with vegetable oil)
- Mashed potatoes ([make with butter and milk](/blog/cooking-basics))
- Roasted vegetables
- Fruit

**3. Small portions of everything**
- Social eating
- Don't refuse completely
- Eat larger portions of safe items

**If family comments:**
"This is what works for me."

**Don't debate.** [You won't change their mind](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

### **Kids' Birthday Parties**

**For your kids:**
- [Let them eat cake at parties](/blog/children-pufas)
- [Occasional exposure is fine](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge)
- [Maintain standards at home](/blog/meal-planning)

**For you:**
- "Already ate"
- Drink water
- Focus on socializing

**[Daily diet matters more than party food](/blog/tracking-symptoms).**

## How to Handle Questions

**"Why aren't you eating [X]?"**
"Not hungry for it."

**"Are you on a diet?"**
"Just eating what makes me feel good."

**"You're so disciplined!"**
"Thanks." [Change subject.]

**"One bite won't hurt."**
"I'm good, thanks."

**"You're being difficult."**
"I appreciate you cooking. I'm eating what I can."

**Keep answers short.** Don't invite debate.

## When to Explain (Rarely)

**Only explain if:**
- They genuinely ask (not challenging)
- They're struggling with health
- They're ready to hear it
- Private conversation (not group setting)

**Then:**
- Share briefly
- [Mention your results](/blog/tracking-symptoms)
- Offer resources if they want
- Don't push

**Most people aren't ready.** That's fine.

## Hosting Events

**Best strategy: Host more.**

**[Cook everything yourself:](/blog/cooking-basics)**
- [Roast chicken](/blog/meal-planning)
- [Baked potatoes](/blog/cooking-basics)
- [Roasted vegetables](/blog/meal-planning)
- [Fruit platters](/blog/meal-planning)
- [Simple desserts (made with butter)](/blog/reading-food-labels)

**Guests won't know it's "special."**

They'll just enjoy good food. You'll have plenty to eat.

**Win-win.**

## Managing Relationships

**Some people will judge you.**

Family: "You're being extreme."
Friends: "You're no fun anymore."

**Your options:**

**1. Ignore it**
[Focus on your health](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). [Let them think what they want](/blog/anxiety-pufas).

**2. Set boundaries**
"This works for me. Please respect that."

**3. Distance if necessary**
If someone can't respect your choices, [spend less time together](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism).

**Your health > their comfort.**

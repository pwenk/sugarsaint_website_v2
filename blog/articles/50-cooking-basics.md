You think cooking is hard.

Complicated recipes. Special ingredients. Perfect technique.

You order takeout. [Eat restaurant food](/blog/restaurant-pufa-guide). Buy frozen meals.

All contain seed oils. All destroy your metabolism.

You need to cook. It's simpler than you think.

*Cooking is like driving. Complicated at first. Then automatic. You don't think. You just do.*

## The Only Cooking Fat You Need

**Butter.**

That's it. Everything can be cooked in butter.

**Also fine:**
- Coconut oil (neutral or refined if you don't like coconut flavor)
- Ghee (clarified butter, higher smoke point)
- Animal fats (bacon fat, duck fat, tallow if you save them)

**Never use:**
- Vegetable oil
- Canola oil
- Soybean oil
- Sunflower oil
- Safflower oil
- Corn oil
- [Any seed oil](/blog/reading-food-labels)

## 5 Basic Cooking Methods

**1. Pan-frying**
- Heat butter in pan
- Add food
- Cook until done
- Salt to taste

**Works for:** Eggs, meat, hash browns, vegetables

**2. Roasting**
- Put food on baking sheet
- Add butter or coat with melted coconut oil
- Salt
- Bake at 375-425°F until done

**Works for:** Chicken, beef, pork, vegetables, potatoes

**3. Boiling**
- Put water in pot
- Bring to boil

- Drain, add butter and salt

**Works for:** Potatoes, rice, pasta, vegetables

**4. Steaming**

- Put in baking dish
- Bake until done

**Works for:** Homemade bread, pancakes, muffins, cookies

Master these five. You can cook anything.

## Simple Meal Formula

**Every meal:**
1. Protein (meat, eggs, fish)
2. Carb (potato, rice, fruit)
3. Vegetable (optional)
4. Butter
5. Salt

**Example 1:**
- Pan-fry ground beef in butter with salt
- Boil white rice
- Steam broccoli, add butter
- Eat fruit on the side

**Example 2:**
- Roast chicken thighs (coat with butter, salt, bake 400°F for 35 minutes)
- Bake potato (coat with butter, salt, bake alongside chicken)
- Raw carrot sticks

**Example 3:**
- Pan-fry eggs in butter
- Pan-fry hash browns in butter
- Orange juice

**This is it.** [Simple. Nutritious. No seed oils](/blog/meal-planning).

## How to Cook Specific Foods

**Meat (beef, pork, lamb, chicken):**
- Pan-fry steaks/chops in butter (medium-high heat, 4-6 minutes per side)
- Roast whole chickens or cuts (400°F, 20-40 minutes depending on size)
- Ground meat: brown in butter, add salt

**Fish:**
- Pan-fry in butter (medium heat, 3-4 minutes per side)
- Bake (coat with butter, 375°F for 15-20 minutes)

**Eggs:**
- Scrambled: crack in bowl, scramble with fork, pour in buttered pan, stir
- Fried: crack into buttered pan, cook to desired doneness
- Boiled: place in water, boil 6-12 minutes depending on desired doneness

**Potatoes:**
- Hash browns: grate potato, squeeze out water, fry in butter until crispy
- Baked: coat with butter, bake 400°F for 60 minutes
- Boiled: cut into chunks, boil until tender (15-20 minutes), add butter

**Rice:**
- Rinse rice
- Add to pot with 2 cups water per 1 cup rice
- Bring to boil, reduce to simmer, cover
- Cook 15-18 minutes
- Add butter and salt

**Vegetables:**
- Steam or boil until tender
- Add butter and salt
- Or roast: coat with melted butter, roast 400°F for 20-30 minutes

## Seasoning

**Salt is all you need.**

Seriously. Salt makes everything taste good.

**Also good:**
- Black pepper
- Garlic powder
- Onion powder
- Dried herbs (oregano, basil, thyme)

**Don't overthink seasoning.** Salt first. Add others if you want.

## Meal Prep Strategy

**Don't meal prep.**

Just cook fresh each time. It takes 20-30 minutes. Less time than driving to restaurant.

**If you must prep:**
- Cook large batch of rice (stores 5 days)
- Roast whole chicken (eat over 2-3 days)
- Hard-boil eggs (snacks for week)

**But honestly:** Fresh cooking is faster and tastes better than reheating.

## Kitchen Equipment

**Minimum needed:**
- 1 large skillet (cast iron or stainless steel)
- 1 large pot
- 1 baking sheet
- Spatula
- Knife
- Cutting board

**That's it.** Don't buy fancy equipment.

## Common Mistakes

**Using too little fat:**
Food sticks. Tastes dry. Use more butter. It's not unhealthy. [It's essential](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat).

**Overcooking:**
Meat gets dry. Vegetables get mushy. Use timer. Check doneness.

**Not salting enough:**
Food tastes bland. Salt until it tastes good. [Your body needs salt](/blog/electrolytes-salt).

**Making it complicated:**
Simple food is better. Meat, potato, vegetable. Repeat. Don't need fancy recipes.

## What About Recipes

**You don't need them.**

Follow the formula: protein + carb + vegetable + butter + salt.

Change the protein. Change the carb. Change the vegetable.

Infinite combinations. All simple. All work.

**If you want recipes:**
Search "butter-based [food name]" or "[food name] no seed oil". Or use old cookbooks (pre-1980s). They used butter.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use olive oil?**
A: [Extra virgin olive oil is fine for cold use (salads)](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat). Don't heat it. Butter is better for cooking.

**Q: What if I don't like coconut flavor?**
A: Buy refined coconut oil. No coconut flavor. Or just use butter for everything.

**Q: How do I cook without food sticking?**
A: Use enough butter. Medium heat (not too high). Let food develop crust before flipping. Cast iron or stainless steel pans work best.

**Q: Can I bake without seed oil?**
A: Yes. Replace vegetable oil with melted butter or coconut oil 1:1 in any recipe. Works perfectly.

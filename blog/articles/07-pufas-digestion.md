# How Do Seed Oils Affect Digestion?

## TL;DR

PUFAs damage your gut lining by causing lipid peroxidation. They increase intestinal permeability (leaky gut). They alter bile composition which affects fat digestion. They feed inflammatory bacteria and starve beneficial bacteria. Bloating, gas, inconsistent stools, and food sensitivities often improve within 2-4 weeks of eliminating seed oils.

You're bloated after every meal.

Gas. Cramping. Your bowel movements are unpredictable. Sometimes constipated. Sometimes loose. Never normal.

You've cut gluten. Dairy. FODMAPs. Nothing helps consistently.

Your digestion is a mess and you don't know why.

Your gut lining has been soaking in oxidized fats for years.

*Your gut lining is a fortress wall. PUFAs are rot spreading through the mortar. The wall develops gaps. Things get through that shouldn't.*

## How PUFAs Damage Your Gut Lining

Your intestinal lining is one cell thick. These cells form a tight barrier. Nutrients pass through. Toxins and undigested food stay out.

This barrier needs healthy cell membranes. When PUFAs incorporate into intestinal cell membranes, they oxidize. Oxidized membranes are damaged membranes.

The tight junctions between cells loosen. Gaps form. Undigested food particles, bacteria, and toxins slip through into your bloodstream.

Your immune system sees these as invaders. It attacks. Inflammation spreads.

This is leaky gut. And PUFAs are a major cause.

The oxidative damage also kills intestinal cells faster than normal. Your gut lining turns over every few days. But when PUFAs accelerate cell death, turnover happens too fast. The new cells don't form tight junctions properly.

More gaps. More leakage. More inflammation.

## How PUFAs Affect Bile and Fat Digestion

Your liver makes bile. Your gallbladder stores it. When you eat fat, bile is released to emulsify it. Break it into small droplets. Make it digestible.

PUFAs change bile composition. They make bile thicker. Sludgier. Less effective at emulsifying fats.

Poor fat digestion means:
- Greasy, floating stools
- Fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies (A, D, E, K)
- Gallstones over time
- Nausea after fatty meals

You're eating fat but not digesting it properly. It passes through unabsorbed. Your gut bacteria ferment it. You get gas and bloating.

Saturated fats like butter are easier to digest. They don't require as much bile. They don't oxidize. Your gut handles them better.

## How PUFAs Alter Gut Bacteria

Your gut bacteria feed on what you eat. Different foods feed different bacteria.

PUFAs, especially when oxidized, feed inflammatory bacteria. They promote the growth of gram-negative bacteria that produce endotoxin (LPS).

Endotoxin leaks through your damaged gut lining into your bloodstream. Your liver has to clear it. If your liver gets overwhelmed, endotoxin circulates. This triggers systemic inflammation.

You feel it as:
- Brain fog after meals
- Fatigue
- Joint pain
- Skin issues
- Mood problems

Saturated fats feed different bacteria. Less endotoxin production. Less systemic inflammation.

Your gut microbiome shifts based on your fat intake. Change the fats, change the bacteria.

## What You Notice

**Bloating after meals.** Especially after eating out. Restaurant food is cooked in seed oils. Your gut responds with gas and distension.

**Inconsistent bowel movements.** Loose one day. Hard the next. Never predictable. This is inflammation and damaged gut lining.

**Food sensitivities that came out of nowhere.** You used to eat dairy fine. Now it bothers you. Leaky gut lets larger food particles through. Your immune system reacts.

**Greasy stools.** Fats aren't being digested. They're passing through. Your bile isn't working right.

**Fatigue and brain fog after eating.** Endotoxin from gut bacteria is leaking into your blood. Your liver is working overtime to clear it.

## What You Do

Stop eating seed oils. Your gut lining will start to heal within days. Tight junctions repair. Cell membranes stabilize.

Eat saturated fats. Butter. Coconut oil. Ghee. Easy to digest. Don't promote inflammatory bacteria. Don't damage gut lining.

Eat enough carbohydrates. Starches and sugars feed beneficial bacteria. They also reduce endotoxin production. White rice. Potatoes. Fruit. Honey.

Ray Peat emphasized this. He found that well-cooked starches and simple sugars support gut health. They're anti-inflammatory when combined with saturated fats.

Avoid raw vegetables if your gut is damaged. Insoluble fiber irritates an inflamed gut lining. Cook your vegetables. Easier to digest.

Consider bone broth. Gelatin supports gut lining repair. Collagen provides amino acids that heal intestinal cells.

Give it time. Most people notice improvement within 2-4 weeks. Bloating decreases. Bowel movements normalize. Food sensitivities lessen.

If symptoms persist after 8 weeks, investigate further. You might have SIBO, parasites, or other gut infections that need treatment.

## FAQ

**Q: Will eliminating seed oils cure my IBS?**
A: It helps significantly for many people. IBS is often undiagnosed gut inflammation and dysbiosis. Removing the inflammatory trigger (PUFAs) allows healing. Not a guaranteed cure but worth trying.

**Q: Should I take probiotics?**
A: Fix your diet first. Probiotics can help but they won't override a bad diet. Once you're off seed oils and eating well, targeted probiotics might provide additional benefit.

**Q: What about fiber supplements?**
A: Not necessary. If your gut is inflamed, adding more fiber can make things worse. Focus on healing the lining first. Well-cooked starches provide gentler fiber.

**Q: Can PUFAs cause SIBO?**
A: They contribute. Damaged gut lining and altered motility from thyroid suppression create conditions for SIBO. Fixing the underlying issues (PUFAs, low thyroid) helps resolve SIBO.

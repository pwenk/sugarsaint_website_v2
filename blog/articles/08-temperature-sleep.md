# Why Does Low Body Temperature Ruin Your Sleep?

## TL;DR

Your body needs to be warm during the day and cool down slightly at night for good sleep. Low metabolic rate means you're cold all day and can't achieve proper temperature rhythm. You fall asleep but wake up at 2-3 AM. Or you can't fall asleep at all. Raise your daytime temperature by fixing metabolism. Better temperature rhythm means better sleep.

You fall asleep fine.

Then you wake up at 2 AM. Wide awake. Mind racing. Can't fall back asleep.

Or you can't fall asleep at all. You lie there for an hour. Finally drift off. Then wake up tired.

You've tried magnesium. Melatonin. Sleep hygiene. Nothing works consistently.

Your body temperature rhythm is broken.

*Sleep is like a tide. It should rise and fall on schedule. Low metabolism means there's no tide. Just stagnant water.*

## How Temperature Controls Sleep

Your body temperature follows a rhythm. Highest in late afternoon. Lowest around 4-5 AM.

The drop from high to low signals your brain to sleep. The rise from low to high signals waking.

If your daytime temperature is already low (below 97.8°F), there's nowhere to drop from. No signal to sleep.

Or your temperature drops too much during the night. You get cold. Stress hormones spike to generate heat. Cortisol and adrenaline wake you up.

This is the 2-3 AM waking. Your body is trying to survive. It pumps out stress hormones to warm you up. Those same hormones make sleep impossible.

## What Low Metabolism Does

Low thyroid function means low energy production. Less energy means less heat. Your waking temperature sits at 96.5°F or 97.0°F.

During the day you're cold. You need coffee and sugar just to function. You rely on adrenaline for energy.

At night your temperature drops further. Now you're at 95°F or 96°F. Too cold. Your body panics.

Cortisol spikes. You wake up. Heart pounding. Mind racing. Anxious about nothing.

You're not having a panic attack. You're hypothermic.

Your body is trying to warm you up. It dumps stress hormones. Those hormones wake you up.

You lie there for two hours. Eventually cortisol drops enough. You fall back asleep. Then your alarm goes off.

## How PUFAs Make It Worse

PUFAs suppress thyroid function. Lower thyroid means lower body temperature.

They also interfere with sleep directly. The oxidative stress from PUFAs activates stress pathways. More cortisol. More adrenaline. Less deep sleep.

Your sleep is lighter. You wake more easily. You don't reach deep restorative stages.

Even if you sleep seven or eight hours, you wake up unrefreshed. Because you didn't get quality sleep.

Saturated fats don't have this effect. They support thyroid function. Higher metabolic rate. Better temperature rhythm. Deeper sleep.

## What You Notice

**Waking at 2-3 AM consistently.** This is the cortisol spike. Your body is too cold. It's trying to warm up.

**Trouble falling asleep even though you're tired.** Your temperature hasn't dropped properly. No sleep signal.

**Waking up cold.** You need to pile on blankets. Even in a warm room you're freezing.

**Waking up anxious.** Racing thoughts. Worried about random things. This is stress hormones, not real anxiety.

**Never feeling rested.** Seven hours of light sleep doesn't restore you. You need deep sleep. You're not getting it.

**Needing sugar or coffee immediately upon waking.** Your body ran on stress hormones all night. You're depleted. You need a quick hit to function.

## What You Do

Fix your daytime temperature. Raise your metabolic rate. Better temperature rhythm follows.

Stop eating seed oils. Add saturated fats. Eat enough carbohydrates.

Your waking temperature should climb from 96.8°F to 97.8°F or higher within a few weeks.

As daytime temperature rises, nighttime drop becomes more pronounced. The signal to sleep gets stronger.

Eat a small snack before bed. Something with carbs and a little fat. Honey in milk. Fruit with cheese. This prevents blood sugar from crashing during the night. Less cortisol spike. Less waking.

Keep your bedroom cool but not cold. 65-68°F. You want to cool down slightly but not freeze.

Track your sleep quality alongside your morning temperature. As temperature improves, sleep should improve.

If you're waking at 2-3 AM, take your temperature right when you wake. If it's below 96.5°F, that's your problem. You're too cold. Eat something. Warm up. You'll fall back asleep.

Most people see sleep improvements within 2-4 weeks of fixing their metabolism. Falling asleep becomes easier. Waking at night decreases. Waking up feels more rested.

## FAQ

**Q: Should I take melatonin?**
A: It might help short-term. But it doesn't fix the root cause. If your temperature rhythm is broken, melatonin can't override it. Fix metabolism first. Then decide if you still need melatonin.

**Q: What about magnesium for sleep?**
A: Many people are deficient. It can help. But again, it's not fixing the underlying temperature issue. Take it if you want. But prioritize metabolic health.

**Q: I wake up to pee at night. Is that related?**
A: Often yes. High cortisol increases urine production. You're waking because you're cold and stressed. Then you notice you have to pee. The waking came first.

**Q: Will eliminating seed oils fix my insomnia completely?**
A: If low metabolism and temperature dysregulation are the cause, yes. If you have other issues (sleep apnea, chronic pain, etc.), you'll need to address those too.

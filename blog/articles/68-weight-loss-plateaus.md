# Why Did Your Weight Loss Plateau? (And How to Fix It)"

## TL;DR

Weight loss plateaus when metabolism suppresses from calorie restriction, low carbs, or overtraining. Don't cut calories more. Fix metabolism: increase food (especially carbs), reduce exercise volume, track temperature. Thyroid recovers. Metabolism rises. Weight loss resumes. Paradoxically, eating more helps you lose fat.

You were losing weight.

Five pounds. Ten pounds. Fifteen pounds. Progress every week.

Then it stopped. Three weeks. Same weight. No change.

You cut calories more. Added cardio. Went lower carb.

Weight stayed the same. Or increased.

You're frustrated. "My body is broken."

Your body isn't broken. [Your metabolism is suppressed](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

*Weight loss is like starting a fire. Initially, small kindling burns hot. Then it dies down. Adding more kindling (restriction) doesn't help. You need bigger logs (more food, better metabolism).*

## Why Plateaus Happen

**Initial weight loss (first 2-8 weeks):**
- Water weight drops (glycogen depletion)
- Fat loss begins
- Calorie deficit works temporarily

**Then metabolism adapts:**
- [Thyroid suppresses (T3 drops)](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Metabolic rate slows](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- Hunger hormones increase (ghrelin up, leptin down)
- [Energy decreases (movement decreases unconsciously)](/blog/energy-crashes)

**Your body defends against prolonged calorie deficit.**

This is normal physiology. Not willpower failure.

## The Thyroid Problem

**Calorie restriction suppresses thyroid.**

[Low calories = body perceives starvation = thyroid downregulates](/blog/intermittent-fasting).

**T3 (active thyroid hormone) drops:**
- Metabolic rate decreases
- [Body temperature drops (below 97.8°F)](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- [Energy plummets](/blog/energy-crashes)
- Fat loss stops

**Even if you keep restricting calories:**
Your body now burns fewer calories. Deficit shrinks or disappears. Weight loss stalls.

**Cutting calories further worsens the problem.**

More restriction = more thyroid suppression = slower metabolism = harder to lose weight.

## The Low-Carb Problem

**[Low-carb diets suppress thyroid.](/blog/low-carb-thyroid)**

[Thyroid needs glucose to convert T4 to T3](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Without adequate carbs:
- T3 drops
- Reverse T3 rises (blocks T3 receptors)
- [Metabolism slows](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)

**This is why:**
- You lose weight first 2-4 weeks on keto (water, some fat)
- Then plateau
- [Can't lose more despite eating 1200 calories and no carbs](/blog/low-carb-thyroid)

**[Thyroid needs carbs](/blog/low-carb-thyroid).** 150-250g daily for most people.

## The Exercise Problem

**Overtraining suppresses thyroid.**

[Chronic cardio + calorie restriction = metabolic disaster](/blog/exercise-metabolism).

**Exercise increases cortisol:**
- [Cortisol blocks T4-to-T3 conversion](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism)
- [High cortisol + low calories = extreme thyroid suppression](/blog/exercise-metabolism)
- [Muscle breaks down](/blog/athletic-performance)
- Fat loss stops

**"Eat less, exercise more" doesn't work long-term.**

Temporary results. Then plateau. Then metabolic damage.

## How to Fix a Plateau

### **1. Increase Food (Especially Carbs)**

**Paradoxically, you need to eat MORE to lose weight.**

[Adequate food supports thyroid](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). [Thyroid drives metabolism](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). Metabolism drives fat loss.

**Increase:**
- [Carbs to 150-250g daily](/blog/meal-planning)
- [Protein to 1.6-2.0g per kg body weight](/blog/meal-planning)
- Total calories to maintenance or slightly above

**[Track temperature:](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)**
- Goal: 98.0-98.6°F upon waking
- Rising temperature = recovering metabolism

**What happens:**
- Week 1-2: Weight may increase (glycogen refills, water retention)
- Week 3-4: [Energy improves](/blog/energy-crashes), [temperature rises](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- Week 6-8: Fat loss resumes (despite eating more)

**This feels counterintuitive. It works.**

### **2. Reduce Exercise Volume**

**[Stop chronic cardio.](/blog/exercise-metabolism)**

Cut exercise to:
- Strength training 2-3x/week (heavy, low reps)
- Walking daily
- Rest days: actual rest

**[More exercise isn't better when metabolism is broken.](/blog/athletic-performance)**

[Less exercise + adequate food = metabolism recovers](/blog/exercise-metabolism). Then body can lose fat.

### **3. Fix Sleep and Stress**

**[Poor sleep suppresses thyroid.](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)**
**[Chronic stress raises cortisol, blocks fat loss.](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism)**

**Prioritize:**
- 7-9 hours sleep nightly
- [Stress management (meditation, walking, therapy)](/blog/anxiety-pufas)
- [Lower work/life stress if possible](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism)

### **4. Ensure PUFA Elimination**

**[If still eating seed oils, you can't fully optimize metabolism.](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)**

**Check for:**
- [Hidden seed oils in packaged foods](/blog/reading-food-labels)
- [Restaurant meals](/blog/restaurant-pufa-guide)
- [Cooking oils](/blog/cooking-basics)

[Complete PUFA elimination is required](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge).

## Timeline for Breaking Plateau

**Week 1-2 (metabolic recovery phase):**
- Increase food, decrease exercise
- [Temperature starts rising](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- Weight may increase 2-5 lbs (glycogen + water)
- [Energy improves](/blog/energy-crashes)

**Week 3-6 (stabilization phase):**
- [Temperature approaches 98°F](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- [Sleep improves](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)
- Weight stabilizes
- [Mood and mental clarity better](/blog/brain-fog-pufas)

**Week 7-12+ (fat loss resumes):**
- Metabolism fully recovered
- [Temperature stable at 98°F+](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- Fat loss resumes (1-2 lbs per week)
- Eating MORE food than during plateau

**Patience required.** Metabolic recovery takes time.

## What If You're Already Eating "Enough"

**If eating 2000+ calories and still plateaued:**

**Check:**
- [Carb intake (need 150-250g daily)](/blog/low-carb-thyroid)
- [Protein adequate (1.6-2.0g per kg)](/blog/meal-planning)
- [Exercise volume (might be overtraining)](/blog/exercise-metabolism)
- [Sleep quality](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)
- [Stress levels](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism)
- [Thyroid labs](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation)

**Get full thyroid panel:**
- TSH, Free T4, [Free T3](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation), [Reverse T3](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation)
- [If Free T3 is low or Reverse T3 is high](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation), [metabolism is suppressed](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)

**[May need thyroid medication temporarily](/blog/thyroid-medication).** Work with doctor.

## Metabolic Damage vs. Normal Plateau

**Normal plateau:**
- [Temperature 98°F+](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- [Pulse 75-85 bpm](/blog/pulse-tracking-guide)
- [Good energy](/blog/energy-crashes)
- [Sleep well](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)
- Just need patience or small calorie adjustment

**Metabolic suppression:**
- [Temperature below 97.8°F](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- [Pulse below 70 or above 90](/blog/pulse-tracking-guide)
- [Chronic fatigue](/blog/energy-crashes)
- [Poor sleep](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)
- Needs metabolic recovery (more food, less exercise)

[Track temperature and pulse to differentiate](/blog/tracking-symptoms).

## FAQ

**Q: How much should I increase calories?**
A: Add 300-500 calories daily, primarily from [carbs (fruit, potatoes, rice)](/blog/meal-planning). [Track temperature](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). Increase until temperature rises to 98°F+.

**Q: Won't eating more make me gain fat?**
A: Initially, you gain 2-5 lbs (glycogen + water, not fat). Then metabolism recovers. Fat loss resumes. [Long-term, higher metabolism burns more fat](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism).

**Q: How long will the plateau last?**
A: With proper intervention (more food, less exercise), metabolism recovers in 6-12 weeks. [Fat loss resumes after that](/blog/tracking-symptoms).

**Q: Should I try a "reverse diet"?**
A: That's what this is. Gradually increase calories while [monitoring temperature and symptoms](/blog/tracking-symptoms). [Metabolism recovers](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Then fat loss resumes.

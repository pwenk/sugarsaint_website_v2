# How Do PUFAs Damage Your Gut and Cause Digestive Issues?

## TL;DR

PUFAs damage gut lining, increase intestinal permeability (leaky gut), disrupt microbiome, and cause chronic inflammation. This leads to bloating, constipation, food sensitivities, and malabsorption. Eliminate seed oils. Eat butter, bone broth, and easy-to-digest foods. Gut heals in 3-6 months. Digestion improves.

Your digestion is broken.

Bloated after every meal. Constipation. Or diarrhea. Or both alternating.

Food sensitivities you never had before. Gluten makes you sick. Dairy hurts. Everything causes problems.

You tried probiotics. Digestive enzymes. Elimination diets. Low-FODMAP. Paleo. Carnivore.

Some things helped temporarily. Nothing fixed it completely.

[Your gut lining is damaged](/blog/pufas-inflammation). [PUFAs did this](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

*Your gut is like a castle wall. Strong mortar keeps invaders out. PUFAs are acid rain. They dissolve the mortar. The wall crumbles. Everything gets through.*

## How PUFAs Damage the Gut Lining

**Your intestinal lining is one cell thick.**

These cells (enterocytes) form a tight barrier. Nutrients pass through. Toxins, bacteria, undigested food stay out.

**Cell membranes contain fat.**

[When you eat PUFAs, they integrate into these membranes](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat). [PUFAs oxidize](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress). Damaged membranes can't maintain tight junctions.

**Result: increased intestinal permeability.**

"Leaky gut." Undigested food particles, bacteria, endotoxins cross into bloodstream. [Immune system attacks them](/blog/pufas-inflammation). Chronic inflammation begins.

**Symptoms:**
- Bloating and gas
- Food sensitivities
- Autoimmune reactions
- [Skin issues (acne, eczema)](/blog/skin-health-pufas)
- [Brain fog](/blog/brain-fog-pufas)
- [Fatigue](/blog/energy-crashes)

## PUFAs and Gut Inflammation

**[Oxidized PUFAs trigger inflammatory response.](/blog/pufas-inflammation)**

Your gut immune system (70% of total immune system) detects oxidized fats. Releases inflammatory cytokines. Attacks gut lining.

**Chronic gut inflammation causes:**
- Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
- Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD worsens)
- Gastritis
- Reflux (GERD)
- Ulcers

**Standard treatment:**
Antacids. PPIs. Anti-inflammatory drugs. Steroids.

**Better approach:**
[Eliminate the source of inflammation](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). Gut heals naturally.

## PUFAs and the Microbiome

**Your gut contains trillions of bacteria.**

Good bacteria (probiotics) help digestion, make vitamins, support immune function.

**PUFAs disrupt microbiome balance:**
- Kill beneficial bacteria
- Allow pathogenic bacteria to overgrow
- [Increase endotoxin (LPS) production](/blog/pufas-inflammation)
- Reduce short-chain fatty acid production

**Dysbiosis symptoms:**
- Constipation or diarrhea
- SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth)
- Candida overgrowth
- Chronic bloating
- Food intolerances

**Taking probiotics won't fix this** if you're still eating seed oils. [Fix the environment](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). Good bacteria return naturally.

## PUFAs and Nutrient Absorption

**Damaged gut can't absorb nutrients properly.**

Even if you eat well, broken gut means malnutrition.

**Common deficiencies from gut damage:**
- [Iron (anemia, fatigue)](/blog/energy-crashes)
- [B12 (neurological issues, low energy)](/blog/brain-fog-pufas)
- [Calcium and vitamin D (weak bones)](/blog/calcium-vitamin-d)
- Fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, K
- [Magnesium (muscle cramps, poor sleep)](/blog/electrolytes-salt)
- Zinc (immune dysfunction, poor wound healing)

**You supplement. Labs stay low.**

Because gut can't absorb them. [Fix gut lining first](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). Then nutrients absorb.

## How to Heal Your Gut

**[Eliminate all seed oils:](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge)**
Every seed oil meal re-damages gut lining. Stop eating them completely.

**[Eat easy-to-digest foods:](/blog/meal-planning)**
- Well-cooked white rice
- Peeled potatoes (boiled or baked)
- Ripe fruit (bananas, melons, cooked apples)
- [Eggs (if tolerated)](/blog/cooking-basics)
- [Well-cooked meat](/blog/cooking-basics)
- Bone broth (glycine heals gut lining)

**[Use stable cooking fats:](/blog/cooking-basics)**
- Butter (butyrate supports gut health)
- Ghee (if dairy-sensitive)
- Coconut oil

**Support gut lining repair:**
- Bone broth daily (collagen, glycine, glutamine)
- Gelatin (gut lining fuel)
- [Adequate salt](/blog/electrolytes-salt) (maintains electrolyte balance)

**[Support thyroid:](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)**
[Low thyroid slows gut motility](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid) (causes constipation). [High thyroid supports gut healing](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism).
- Adequate carbs
- Iodine from seafood or iodized salt
- [Track temperature](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)

**Avoid temporarily (while healing):**
- Raw vegetables (hard to digest)
- Nuts and seeds (high PUFA, irritating)
- Grains besides white rice (inflammatory for damaged gut)
- Dairy (if sensitive—try again after 3-6 months)

**Timeline:**
- Week 2-4: Bloating reduces
- Month 2-3: [Bowel movements normalize](/blog/tracking-symptoms)
- Month 3-6: Food tolerances improve
- Month 6-12: Gut fully healed, can reintroduce foods

## What About Probiotics and Supplements

**Probiotics:**
May help modestly. But won't fix leaky gut if still eating PUFAs.

**If using probiotics:**
- Choose multi-strain (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium)
- 10-50 billion CFU
- Or eat fermented foods (sauerkraut, yogurt if tolerated)

**L-glutamine:**
Fuel for intestinal cells. May speed healing. 5-10g daily.

**Digestive enzymes:**
Can help symptoms temporarily. Don't fix root cause.

**Betaine HCl:**
If low stomach acid. Can improve protein digestion.

**[Fix diet first](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge).** Supplements are optional add-ons.

## Testing Gut Health

**Stool tests:**
- Microbiome analysis (limited usefulness)
- Calprotectin (inflammation marker)
- Parasites, pathogens

**Blood tests:**
- Nutrient levels (iron, B12, vitamin D)
- [Inflammation markers (CRP, ESR)](/blog/pufas-inflammation)

**Intestinal permeability test:**
Lactulose-mannitol test. Measures leaky gut.

**Most useful approach:**
[Track symptoms](/blog/tracking-symptoms). If digestion improves after [eliminating PUFAs](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge), gut is healing.

## Gut-Brain Connection

**Gut and brain communicate (vagus nerve).**

[Damaged gut affects mental health](/blog/anxiety-pufas):
- [Depression](/blog/brain-fog-pufas)
- [Anxiety](/blog/anxiety-pufas)
- [Brain fog](/blog/brain-fog-pufas)
- [Poor sleep](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)

**Mechanism:**
- Leaky gut → endotoxins enter blood → cross blood-brain barrier
- [Inflammation in brain](/blog/pufas-inflammation)
- [Neurotransmitter production disrupted](/blog/anxiety-pufas)

**Many people report better mood** after fixing gut health. [Eliminate PUFAs](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). Gut heals. [Mental clarity returns](/blog/brain-fog-pufas).

## FAQ

**Q: I have IBS. Will eliminating PUFAs fix it?**
A: For many people, yes. [IBS is often leaky gut and inflammation](/blog/pufas-inflammation). [Eliminate seed oils](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge), [support gut healing](/blog/meal-planning). Symptoms often resolve in 3-6 months.

**Q: Can I eat fiber while healing my gut?**
A: Start low. White rice, peeled potatoes, ripe fruit. As gut heals (month 3+), add cooked vegetables. Raw vegetables last.

**Q: How do I know if my gut is healed?**
A: Symptoms improve. Regular bowel movements. No bloating. Food tolerances expand. [Energy improves](/blog/energy-crashes). [Sleep improves](/blog/body-temperature-sleep).

**Q: Will my food sensitivities go away?**
A: Many do. Once gut lining heals, immune system calms. Foods you couldn't tolerate become fine again. Try reintroducing after 6 months of healing.

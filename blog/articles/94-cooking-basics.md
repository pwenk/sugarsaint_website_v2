# How to Cook Without Seed Oils (Complete Guide)

## TL;DR

Cook with butter, ghee, coconut oil, or animal fats (tallow, lard, duck fat). Use butter for most cooking (sautéing, baking, roasting). Ghee for higher heat. Coconut oil for neutral flavor. Olive oil only cold (salads). Never use seed oils. Cast iron, stainless steel, or carbon steel pans. Avoid non-stick. Most foods taste better with butter anyway.

You want to eliminate seed oils.

But you don't know what to cook with.

"Everything sticks to the pan." "Butter burns." "Food tastes weird."

[You've cooked with canola oil for years](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). Don't know any other way.

Cooking without seed oils is easy.

[Once you know how](/blog/meal-planning).

*Cooking with seed oils is like using cheap paint. Works. But damages surface. Real materials (butter, ghee) work better and don't damage anything.*

## Common Cooking Questions

### **"Won't butter burn?"**

**At moderate heat, no.**

**Tips:**
- Use medium heat (not high)

### **"Everything sticks to my pan."**

**Solutions:**

**1. Preheat pan properly**
Wait 2-3 minutes on heat before adding fat

**2. Use enough fat**

## Seasoning Cast Iron

**How to season new cast iron:**

2. Dry completely
3. Rub thin layer of fat (butter, tallow, ghee) over entire surface
4. Wipe off excess (should look dry)

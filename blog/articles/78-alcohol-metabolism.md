# How Does Alcohol Affect Your Metabolism?

## TL;DR

Alcohol suppresses thyroid, impairs liver function, disrupts sleep, and prioritizes its own metabolism over fat burning. Occasional drinking (1-2 drinks/week) probably fine for healthy metabolism. Frequent drinking (3+ drinks/week) slows metabolic recovery. Daily drinking prevents healing. If optimizing metabolism, limit or eliminate alcohol temporarily.

You drink regularly.

Wine with dinner. Beer on weekends. Cocktails with friends.

"Moderate" by standard guidelines. One or two drinks most nights.

But you're not losing weight. [Energy is low](/blog/energy-crashes). [Sleep is poor](/blog/body-temperature-sleep). [Mood unstable](/blog/anxiety-pufas).

You wonder if alcohol is the problem.

It is.

*Alcohol is like pouring sand in your gas tank. Car runs. But not well. Eventually, it breaks down.*

## What Alcohol Does to Metabolism

**Alcohol is a toxin.**

Your liver prioritizes detoxifying it. Everything else stops:
- Fat burning halts
- [Thyroid hormone production slows](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- Glycogen synthesis pauses
- [Protein synthesis decreases](/blog/exercise-metabolism)

**While alcohol is in your system:**
Your metabolism focuses on eliminating poison. [All other processes wait](/blog/liver-health).

## Alcohol and Thyroid Function

**[Alcohol suppresses thyroid.](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)**

**Mechanisms:**
- Damages liver (where T4 converts to T3)
- [Reduces T4-to-T3 conversion directly](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- Increases cortisol (which suppresses thyroid)
- [Depletes nutrients needed for thyroid (B vitamins, zinc, selenium)](/blog/electrolytes-salt)

**Even moderate drinking:**
2-3 drinks several nights per week suppress thyroid function measurably.

**[If thyroid is already low](/blog/thyroid-medication), alcohol makes it worse.**

## Alcohol and Sleep

**[Alcohol disrupts sleep quality.](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)**

**You fall asleep faster.** But:
- REM sleep reduces
- Deep sleep reduces
- Wake frequently in second half of night
- [Wake unrefreshed](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)

**[Poor sleep suppresses thyroid](/blog/body-temperature-sleep).**

[Even one drink can impair sleep](/blog/body-temperature-sleep). [Multiple drinks guarantee poor sleep](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism).

## Alcohol and Fat Loss

**Alcohol prevents fat burning.**

**Priority:**
1. Alcohol metabolism (toxic, must be eliminated)
2. Carbohydrate metabolism
3. Protein metabolism
4. Fat metabolism (last)

**When drinking:**
Fat burning stops entirely. Calories from alcohol (and food eaten with it) store as fat.

**"Empty calories":**
Alcohol provides 7 calories per gram. No nutrients. Just energy your body must process and store.

**[If trying to lose weight](/blog/weight-loss-plateaus), alcohol stalls progress.**

## Alcohol and Liver Health

**Your liver detoxifies alcohol.**

**Chronic drinking:**
- Fatty liver develops
- [Liver function declines](/blog/pufas-gut-health)
- [Hormone metabolism impairs](/blog/pufas-womens-hormones)
- [T4-to-T3 conversion slows](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)

**Even "moderate" drinking:**
2-3 drinks daily can cause fatty liver over time. [Combined with seed oils](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge), liver damage accelerates.

**[Liver health is critical for metabolism](/blog/pufas-gut-health).**

Alcohol damages it.

## How Much Is Too Much

**For metabolic optimization:**

**Occasional (fine for most):**
- 1-2 drinks per week
- Special occasions
- Minimal impact if metabolism is healthy

**Moderate (slows progress):**
- 3-5 drinks per week
- Noticeably impairs recovery
- [Weight loss slows](/blog/weight-loss-plateaus)
- [Sleep quality declines](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)

**Frequent (prevents healing):**
- 6+ drinks per week (or daily drinking)
- [Thyroid function suppressed](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Liver function impaired](/blog/pufas-gut-health)
- [Metabolism can't recover](/blog/tracking-symptoms)

**If fixing broken metabolism:**
Consider eliminating alcohol for 3-6 months. [Let body heal](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Reintroduce occasionally if desired.

## Types of Alcohol

**All alcohol is metabolized the same.**

Wine, beer, spirits—liver processes ethanol identically.

**But:**

**Wine (red or white):**
- 5oz = ~120 calories
- Some antioxidants (red wine)
- [Don't rely on "health benefits"—minimal](/blog/fructose-myth)

**Beer:**
- 12oz = ~150 calories
- Gluten (problematic for some)
- [Often contains seed oils in brewing process](/blog/reading-food-labels)

**Spirits (vodka, whiskey, tequila):**
- 1.5oz = ~100 calories
- [Mixers often contain sugar or seed oils](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth)

**Cocktails:**
- Calories from alcohol + sugar + [seed oils (in some mixes)](/blog/reading-food-labels)
- Worst choice for metabolism

**[If drinking, choose:](/blog/meal-planning)**
- Dry wine or spirits with soda water
- Minimal mixers
- Limit to 1-2 drinks

## Alcohol and Nutrient Depletion

**Alcohol depletes:**
- [B vitamins (especially B1, B6, folate)](/blog/energy-crashes)
- [Magnesium](/blog/electrolytes-salt)
- Zinc
- [Vitamin A](/blog/skin-health-pufas)

**These nutrients are essential for:**
- [Thyroid function](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Energy production](/blog/energy-crashes)
- [Immune function](/blog/autoimmune-pufas)
- [Hormone production](/blog/testosterone-pufas)

**Chronic drinking creates deficiencies.** [Even with good diet](/blog/meal-planning).

## What If You Can't Stop Drinking

**If alcohol is problematic:**
- Can't limit to 1-2 drinks
- Drinking daily
- Using alcohol to cope with stress or sleep

**This is dependency.**

**Seek help:**
- AA meetings
- Addiction counselor
- Medical support for withdrawal (if severe)

**[Metabolic optimization helps.](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)**

[Many people find cravings for alcohol decrease](/blog/craving-sugar) once:
- [Thyroid is supported](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Blood sugar is stable](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth)
- [Sleep improves](/blog/body-temperature-sleep)
- [Energy normalizes](/blog/energy-crashes)

**[Fix metabolism](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). Alcohol becomes less appealing.**

## FAQ

**Q: Can I drink wine and still optimize metabolism?**
A: Occasional wine (1-2x/week) probably won't prevent progress. [But daily wine slows recovery](/blog/tracking-symptoms). [Try eliminating for 3 months](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge), [see how you feel](/blog/tracking-symptoms).

**Q: Is red wine heart-healthy?**
A: Antioxidants in red wine are minimal. [You'd get more from berries](/blog/fructose-myth). ["Health benefits" are overstated](/blog/cholesterol-myth). [Alcohol's negatives outweigh wine's positives](/blog/pufas-inflammation).

**Q: What if I only drink on weekends?**
A: [Weekend binge drinking](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism) (3-5+ drinks) is worse than 1 drink daily for metabolism. [Disrupts sleep](/blog/body-temperature-sleep), [spikes cortisol](/blog/cortisol-stress-metabolism), [impairs recovery all week](/blog/exercise-metabolism).

**Q: Will quitting alcohol improve my thyroid?**
A: [If drinking 3+ drinks/week, yes](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). [Many people notice temperature rise](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism), [energy improve](/blog/energy-crashes), [sleep quality increase](/blog/body-temperature-sleep) within 2-4 weeks of quitting.

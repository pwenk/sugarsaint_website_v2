# Why Can't You Sleep? The Body Temperature Connection

## TL;DR

Good sleep requires metabolic heat. Low thyroid means low body temperature. Cold hands and feet at night signal poor circulation and low metabolism. Can't fall asleep or stay asleep. Fix thyroid. Temperature rises. Sleep improves. Deep sleep returns.

---

You can't sleep.

You lie awake for hours. Mind racing. Body restless. Finally fall asleep at 3am.

Then wake at 5am. Can't fall back asleep. Or wake every 2 hours. Never feel rested.

Your doctor prescribed Ambien. Melatonin. Sleep hygiene advice. Blue light glasses. Weighted blankets.

Nothing works. You're still exhausted.

Your body temperature is too low. [Your thyroid is broken](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

*Sleep is like a fire. You need fuel (calories) and heat (metabolism) to keep it burning. Low thyroid is cold, damp wood. The fire keeps going out.*

## The Temperature-Sleep Connection

**Normal sleep requires:**
- Body temperature drop of 1-2°F at night
- Adequate metabolic heat production
- Warm core, cool extremities
- Stable blood sugar through the night

**When thyroid is suppressed:**
- [Core temperature is already low (below 97.5°F)](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)
- Can't generate metabolic heat
- Hands and feet are cold
- Body struggles to maintain temperature stability

**Result:**
- Can't fall asleep (body too cold)
- Wake frequently (blood sugar drops, adrenaline rises)
- Wake early and can't return to sleep
- [Never reach deep sleep](/blog/energy-crashes)

## How Low Thyroid Disrupts Sleep

**Insomnia pattern:**
[Low thyroid means low metabolic rate](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Low metabolism means poor heat production. Your body can't maintain stable temperature.

**At night:**
Your body needs to cool slightly to initiate sleep. But if you're already too cold, the drop pushes you into stress response. Cortisol rises. Adrenaline rises. You stay awake.

**Middle-of-night waking:**
Blood sugar drops. No thyroid-driven metabolism to maintain stable glucose. Stress hormones spike to raise blood sugar. You wake up. [Heart pounding](/blog/pulse-tracking-guide). [Anxious](/blog/anxiety-pufas). Wide awake.

**Early morning waking:**
Cortisol rises naturally around 4-5am. If metabolism is broken, cortisol surge is exaggerated. You wake. Can't fall back asleep.

**This isn't psychological insomnia.** It's metabolic.

## PUFAs and Sleep

[PUFAs suppress thyroid](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Low thyroid causes temperature dysregulation.

**[PUFAs also:](/blog/pufas-inflammation)**
- Increase inflammation (sleep disruption)
- [Damage mitochondria (less heat production)](/blog/pufas-oxidative-stress)
- Increase stress hormones (cortisol stays elevated)
- [Cause blood sugar instability](/blog/sugar-insulin-myth)

**All of these disrupt sleep.**

[Eliminate PUFAs](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). Thyroid recovers. Temperature stabilizes. Sleep improves.

## How to Fix Sleep Through Metabolism

**[Eliminate seed oils completely.](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge)**

**[Support thyroid function:](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)**
- Adequate carbs (glycogen stores for overnight energy)
- Iodine from seafood or iodized salt
- Selenium from Brazil nuts or meat
- [Track morning temperature (goal: 98°F+)](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)

**Eat adequate calories:**
[Undereating suppresses thyroid](/blog/intermittent-fasting). Eat to satiety. Include carbs at dinner (stabilizes blood sugar overnight).

**[Evening meal strategy:](/blog/meal-planning)**
- Protein + carbs + fat
- 2-3 hours before bed
- [Includes starch (potato, rice)](/blog/meal-planning)
- Small dessert with sugar if desired (helps some people sleep)

**Reduce stress:**
[Chronic stress suppresses thyroid](/blog/anxiety-pufas). Meditation, walking, less intense exercise. Lower cortisol helps sleep.

**Be patient:**
- Week 2-4: May notice slight improvement
- Month 2-3: Fall asleep faster, fewer wake-ups
- Month 3-6: Deep sleep returns, wake refreshed

## What About Sleep Supplements

**Melatonin:**
- Helps some people fall asleep
- Doesn't fix metabolic cause
- Can suppress thyroid at high doses
- Try 0.3-1mg (most supplements are 5-10mg, too high)

**Magnesium:**
- [Magnesium glycinate helps muscle relaxation](/blog/electrolytes-salt)
- Take 300-400mg before bed
- Won't fix sleep if thyroid is broken, but may help

**CBD/THC:**
- May help fall asleep
- Doesn't improve deep sleep quality
- Doesn't fix root cause

**Prescription sleep meds:**
- Work short-term
- Don't improve sleep quality (suppress REM and deep sleep)
- [Don't fix metabolism](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)

**Fix thyroid first.** Supplements are bandaids.

## Sleep Hygiene (When It Actually Helps)

**Standard advice works when metabolism is healthy:**
- Dark room
- Cool temperature (65-68°F)
- No screens 1 hour before bed
- Consistent sleep schedule

**But if metabolism is broken, sleep hygiene won't fix it.**

**Prioritize:**
1. [Fix thyroid](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
2. [Stabilize blood sugar](/blog/meal-planning)
3. Then optimize sleep environment

## Tracking Sleep Improvement

**[Temperature:](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)**
Take oral temperature upon waking (before getting out of bed). Goal: 98.0-98.6°F. As temperature rises, sleep improves.

**[Pulse:](/blog/pulse-tracking-guide)**
Resting pulse should be 75-85 bpm. If pulse is high (90+) or low (below 70), metabolism isn't optimized yet.

**Sleep quality markers:**
- Fall asleep within 15-20 minutes
- Sleep through night (or one wake to use bathroom)
- Wake refreshed (not groggy)
- [Stable energy through morning](/blog/energy-crashes)

**If temperature normalizes but sleep doesn't improve:**
- Check cortisol (saliva test)
- Evaluate stress levels
- Consider sleep study (rule out apnea)

## FAQ

**Q: My hands and feet are freezing at night. Why?**
A: [Low thyroid means poor circulation](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). Blood flow prioritizes core organs. Extremities get cold. As thyroid improves, circulation improves. Hands and feet warm up.

**Q: I wake up sweating. Is that related to metabolism?**
A: Yes. Night sweats often indicate blood sugar crash → adrenaline surge. [Fix blood sugar stability by eating adequate carbs](/blog/meal-planning). [Support thyroid](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Night sweats usually resolve.

**Q: Will fixing my thyroid cure sleep apnea?**
A: [Low thyroid worsens sleep apnea](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid) (reduces upper airway muscle tone). Improving metabolism may reduce severity. But diagnosed sleep apnea needs medical treatment (CPAP).

**Q: How much sleep do I need?**
A: 7-9 hours for most people. [Quality matters more than quantity](/blog/energy-crashes). If you need 10+ hours to feel rested, metabolism is suppressed.

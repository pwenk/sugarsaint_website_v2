# The 7-Day PUFA Purge: What Happens When You Eliminate Seed Oils?

## TL;DR

Eliminate all seed oils for 7 days. Track temperature, pulse, energy, and symptoms. Most people notice warmer hands, better energy, clearer thinking, and less hunger by day 5-7. This week proves whether PUFAs are your problem. If you improve, continue. If nothing changes, look elsewhere.

You've read about PUFAs.

You think they might be causing your problems. Low energy. Cold hands. Brain fog. Weight you can't lose.

But you're not sure. Everyone's different, right?

Stop theorizing. Run the experiment.

*Seven days without seed oils is like taking off sunglasses you didn't know you were wearing. The world gets brighter.*

## The Protocol

**Days 1-7: Zero PUFAs**

**Eliminate completely:**
- Vegetable oil, canola oil, soybean oil
- Sunflower oil, safflower oil, corn oil
- Margarine and "vegetable spreads"
- All fried restaurant food
- Packaged snacks (chips, crackers, granola bars)
- Salad dressings (almost all contain soybean oil)
- Mayonnaise (unless made with olive or avocado oil)
- Baked goods (bread, muffins, cookies)
- Nut butters (many contain added oils)

**Cook with instead:**
- Butter
- Coconut oil
- Ghee
- Beef tallow
- Duck fat

**Eat freely:**
- Meat, eggs, dairy
- Fruit, potatoes, white rice, honey
- Vegetables cooked in butter or eaten raw
- Salt, herbs, spices

**No restaurant meals.** Not even "safe" ones. Commit to home cooking for 7 days. You need a clean baseline.

## What to Track

**Temperature:** [Measure morning and afternoon](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). Write it down every day.

**Pulse:** [Morning resting pulse](/blog/pulse-tracking-guide). Count for 60 seconds.

**Energy level:** Rate 1-10. Morning, afternoon, evening.

**Mental clarity:** Brain fog, focus, mood. Rate 1-10.

**Hunger/satiety:** Are you ravenous or satisfied? How long between meals?

**Sleep quality:** Easy to fall asleep? Wake during night? Feel rested?

**Physical warmth:** Cold hands/feet or comfortably warm?

**Digestion:** Bowel movements, bloating, gas.

Keep a simple daily log. Don't skip this. You need data, not feelings.

## What Happens Day by Day

**Day 1-2:** You might not notice much. Your cells are still full of stored PUFAs. Some people feel slightly worse—this is withdrawal as your body starts mobilizing stored fats.

**Day 3-4:** Energy starts improving. Hands and feet feel warmer. Less afternoon crash. You might notice you're less hungry between meals.

**Day 5-7:** Most people see clear improvements. Temperature climbs. Pulse strengthens. Brain fog lifts. You wake up with energy. Your digestion improves. You feel warmer throughout the day.

Not everyone responds this fast. Some people take 2-3 weeks. But 7 days is enough to know if you're on the right track.

## What Your Data Shows

**Good signs (PUFAs were your problem):**
- Temperature increases 0.2-0.5°F or more
- Pulse increases toward 75-85 range if it was low
- Energy improves, especially afternoon
- Hands and feet noticeably warmer
- Less brain fog, better focus
- Sleep quality improves
- Reduced hunger, stable blood sugar
- Digestion improves

**Neutral/no change:**
- Temperature stays the same
- Energy unchanged
- No noticeable difference in warmth or symptoms

If you see no improvement after 7 days, PUFAs might not be your main issue. Consider other factors: chronic stress, sleep deprivation, undiagnosed thyroid disease, gut infections.

But most people see at least some improvement.

## What to Do After Day 7

**If you improved significantly:** Continue eliminating PUFAs. Your metabolism is responding. Give it 4-8 weeks for deeper healing. [Your thyroid function should continue improving](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

**If you improved slightly:** Continue for another 2-3 weeks. Some people need longer for stored PUFAs to clear. Track your data. Look for trends.

**If nothing changed:** PUFAs might not be your primary issue. But don't immediately return to seed oils. Consider working with a functional medicine doctor to investigate other metabolic problems.

## Common Challenges

**"I ate out once and ruined it."**
No, you didn't. One meal isn't ideal but won't destroy 7 days. Note it in your log and continue. This is about gathering data, not perfection.

**"I'm so hungry without snacks."**
Eat more at meals. Add potatoes, rice, fruit. Don't restrict calories. This isn't a diet. You're replacing PUFAs, not starving.

**"I feel worse on day 2-3."**
Common. Your body is mobilizing stored PUFAs. You might feel fatigued or off. Push through. Most people feel better by day 4-5.

**"My family won't do this with me."**
Cook your food separately. Pack your lunch. It's 7 days. You can manage cooking for yourself temporarily.

## Example Day of Eating

**Breakfast:**
- 3 eggs cooked in butter
- Hash browns cooked in butter
- Orange juice
- Coffee with cream

**Lunch:**
- Burger patty (no bun or bun if homemade)
- Baked potato with butter and sour cream
- Steamed broccoli with butter

**Dinner:**
- Grilled chicken thighs
- White rice
- Carrots cooked in butter
- Fruit salad

**Snacks (if needed):**
- Cheese
- Fruit
- Yogurt with honey

Simple. Filling. Zero PUFAs.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use olive oil?**
A: Extra virgin olive oil is mostly monounsaturated, not polyunsaturated. It's acceptable for cold use (salads). Don't heat it. Better to stick with saturated fats for cooking during the 7 days to keep it simple.

**Q: What about nuts?**
A: Nuts contain PUFAs naturally. Some people avoid them during the purge. Others eat small amounts. If you're doing a strict experiment, skip them for 7 days.

**Q: Do I need to count calories?**
A: No. Eat until satisfied. Most people naturally eat less because [satiety improves when you're not eating inflammatory fats](/blog/pufas-vs-sugar-obesity).

**Q: What if I don't have time to cook?**
A: This experiment requires effort. If you're not willing to cook for 7 days, you're not ready to find out if PUFAs are your problem. Prioritize it or wait until you can.

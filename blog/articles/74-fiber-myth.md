# Do You Really Need 30+ Grams of Fiber Daily?

## TL;DR

High-fiber recommendations are overstated. Too much fiber causes bloating, gas, constipation for many people. Adequate thyroid function drives gut motility better than fiber. Eat fruit, cooked vegetables, white rice, potatoes. Moderate fiber (15-25g) from whole foods is fine. Don't force salads and bran if your gut rebels.

You're eating fiber.

Tons of it. Salads. Vegetables. Whole grains. Chia seeds. Psyllium husk.

"30 grams daily" they said. "Fiber prevents everything."

You followed the advice. Now you're bloated. Constipated. [Gas constantly](/blog/pufas-gut-health). [Stomach hurts](/blog/pufas-gut-health).

More fiber didn't help. It made things worse.

[Your gut needs metabolic support, not more roughage](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid).

*Fiber is like sandpaper. A little smooths wood. Too much wears it down. Your gut isn't meant to process pounds of roughage daily.*

## The Fiber Recommendation

**Standard advice:**
25-30+ grams of fiber daily. More is better. Prevents constipation, colon cancer, heart disease.

**Reality:**
This recommendation comes from epidemiological studies. People eating more fiber tend to be healthier.

**But correlation ≠ causation.**

People eating high fiber also:
- Eat more vegetables and fruit (vitamins, minerals)
- Eat less processed food
- [Exercise more](/blog/exercise-metabolism)
- Don't smoke

**Is it the fiber? Or everything else?**

## What Fiber Actually Does

**Fiber is indigestible plant matter.**

**Two types:**

**Soluble fiber:**
- Dissolves in water
- Forms gel in gut
- Feeds gut bacteria
- Found in: oats, beans, apples, carrots

**Insoluble fiber:**
- Doesn't dissolve
- Adds bulk to stool
- "Roughage"
- Found in: wheat bran, vegetables, whole grains

**Both pass through undigested.**

## Problems with High Fiber

**Bloating and gas:**
[Gut bacteria ferment fiber](/blog/pufas-gut-health). Produces gas. [Too much fiber = excessive gas](/blog/pufas-gut-health).

**Constipation:**
Paradoxically, too much fiber without adequate water can worsen constipation. Fiber absorbs water. [Dry, bulky stool is hard to pass](/blog/pufas-gut-health).

**Nutrient malabsorption:**
Fiber binds minerals (iron, calcium, zinc). Excessive fiber reduces absorption.

**Gut irritation:**
[Insoluble fiber can irritate damaged gut lining](/blog/pufas-gut-health). [If gut is inflamed from PUFAs](/blog/pufas-gut-health), [high fiber worsens symptoms](/blog/pufas-gut-health).

**Phytic acid:**
High-fiber foods (grains, legumes) contain phytic acid. Binds minerals. Reduces bioavailability.

## What Actually Prevents Constipation

**[Adequate thyroid function.](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)**

[Low thyroid slows gut motility](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). Food moves slowly. Constipation develops.

**[Fix thyroid:](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)**
- [Adequate carbs](/blog/meal-planning)
- Iodine and selenium
- [Eliminate PUFAs](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge)
- [Track temperature](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism)

**[Many people's constipation resolves](/blog/pufas-gut-health)** when thyroid function improves. No fiber supplements needed.

**Other factors:**
- [Adequate hydration](/blog/electrolytes-salt)
- [Salt (supports gut motility)](/blog/electrolytes-salt)
- [Magnesium (relaxes intestinal muscles)](/blog/electrolytes-salt)
- [Movement (walking stimulates gut)](/blog/exercise-metabolism)

**Fiber is not the primary solution.**

## Optimal Fiber Intake

**15-25 grams daily from whole foods.**

**Good sources:**
- [Fruit (apples, berries, oranges)](/blog/fructose-myth)
- Cooked vegetables (carrots, broccoli, green beans)
- Potatoes (with skin)
- White rice (yes, it has some fiber)

**Don't force:**
- Large salads if they bloat you
- Whole grains if they irritate your gut
- Fiber supplements (psyllium, Metamucil)
- Beans and legumes (if they cause gas)

**[Listen to your body](/blog/tracking-symptoms).** [If high fiber causes problems, reduce it](/blog/pufas-gut-health).

## Fiber and Gut Health

**"Fiber feeds good bacteria."**

True. Gut bacteria ferment fiber. Produce short-chain fatty acids (butyrate). Good for colon health.

**But:**

[If gut is damaged from PUFAs](/blog/pufas-gut-health), fiber fermentation causes excessive gas and bloating.

**[Heal gut first:](/blog/pufas-gut-health)**
- [Eliminate seed oils](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge)
- [Eat easy-to-digest foods (bone broth, well-cooked meat, white rice, fruit)](/blog/meal-planning)
- [Reduce fiber temporarily](/blog/pufas-gut-health)

**After 3-6 months:**
[Gut heals](/blog/pufas-gut-health). Fiber tolerance improves. [Gradually add cooked vegetables](/blog/meal-planning).

**[Don't force fiber while gut is broken](/blog/pufas-gut-health).**

## What About Colon Cancer

**"Fiber prevents colon cancer."**

Epidemiological association. Not proven causation.

**Other factors that reduce colon cancer:**
- [Not eating processed meat (often cooked in seed oils)](/blog/reading-food-labels)
- [Not eating fried food (seed oils)](/blog/restaurant-pufa-guide)
- [Eating more fruit and vegetables (vitamins, antioxidants)](/blog/fructose-myth)
- [Exercise](/blog/exercise-metabolism)
- Adequate vitamin D

**Fiber might help.** But [it's not the magic bullet](/blog/pufas-inflammation).

[Eliminate seed oils](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). [Eat nutrient-dense food](/blog/meal-planning). These matter more.

## Fiber Supplements

**Psyllium husk, Metamucil, fiber gummies:**

**When they help:**
- Occasional constipation
- Transition off laxatives
- Short-term use

**Problems:**
- Don't fix root cause ([low thyroid](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid), [dehydration](/blog/electrolytes-salt))
- Can cause dependency
- [Bloating and gas common](/blog/pufas-gut-health)
- Interfere with medication absorption

**Better approach:**
- [Fix thyroid](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- [Adequate water and salt](/blog/electrolytes-salt)
- [Magnesium glycinate (relaxes gut)](/blog/electrolytes-salt)
- [Movement](/blog/exercise-metabolism)

**Use fiber supplements sparingly.** Not daily long-term.

## Low-Fiber Foods Can Be Healthy

**White rice:**
- Easy to digest
- [Provides glucose for thyroid](/blog/low-carb-thyroid)
- Doesn't irritate gut
- Low fiber is fine

**Fruit juice:**
- [Provides quick carbs](/blog/fructose-myth)
- [Supports thyroid](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- Low fiber doesn't make it unhealthy

**Well-cooked vegetables:**
- Easier to digest than raw
- [Nutrients more bioavailable](/blog/children-pufas)
- Lower fiber load = less gas

**[Peeled potatoes:](/blog/meal-planning)**
- Digestible starch
- Potassium
- Less fiber = gentler on gut

**Don't fear low-fiber foods.** [They can support healing](/blog/pufas-gut-health).

## FAQ

**Q: I need 30g fiber to stay regular. Is that bad?**
A: [Check thyroid function](/blog/thyroid-labs-interpretation). [Most people need less fiber once metabolism is optimized](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid). [If 30g works for you now, fine](/blog/tracking-symptoms). But try [improving thyroid function](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)—[fiber needs often decrease](/blog/pufas-gut-health).

**Q: Should I eat salads every day?**
A: Only if you enjoy them and tolerate them well. [If salads bloat you, skip them](/blog/pufas-gut-health). [Cooked vegetables provide same nutrients, easier to digest](/blog/meal-planning).

**Q: Is fiber necessary for weight loss?**
A: No. [Fiber helps satiety](/blog/weight-loss-plateaus). But [protein and adequate carbs also promote fullness](/blog/meal-planning). [Many people lose weight eating low-fiber diets (white rice, fruit, meat)](/blog/keto-thyroid).

**Q: What if I have IBS?**
A: [Many IBS symptoms improve with PUFA elimination and gut healing](/blog/pufas-gut-health). [High fiber often worsens IBS](/blog/pufas-gut-health). Try low-fiber, easy-to-digest foods for 3-6 months. [Gut heals](/blog/pufas-gut-health). Symptoms improve.

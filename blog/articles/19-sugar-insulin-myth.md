# Does Sugar Actually Cause Insulin Resistance?

## TL;DR

Sugar doesn't cause insulin resistance. PUFAs in cell membranes do. When your cells are full of polyunsaturated fats, insulin can't signal properly. Glucose can't enter. Your pancreas makes more insulin to compensate. This is insulin resistance. Remove PUFAs, and cells respond to insulin again. Sugar becomes useful fuel, not a problem.

You've heard it your whole life.

Sugar causes diabetes. Sugar makes you fat. Sugar is poison.

Cut sugar, fix insulin resistance.

You tried. Low-carb. Keto. Carnivore.

Your blood sugar improved slightly. But you're exhausted. Cold. Can't think clearly. Lost your period. Can't lose weight anymore.

Sugar isn't the problem. Your cell membranes are.

*Insulin is a key. PUFAs change the lock. The key still works—it just can't open the door anymore.*

## What Insulin Resistance Actually Is

Your cells need glucose for energy. Insulin is the hormone that tells cells to take in glucose.

**Normal insulin signaling:**
1. You eat food containing glucose
2. Blood sugar rises
3. Pancreas releases insulin
4. Insulin binds to receptors on cell membranes
5. Cells open glucose channels
6. Glucose enters cells
7. Blood sugar normalizes

**Insulin resistance:**
1. You eat food containing glucose
2. Blood sugar rises
3. Pancreas releases insulin
4. Insulin tries to bind to receptors
5. Cells don't respond properly
6. Glucose can't enter cells
7. Blood sugar stays high
8. Pancreas makes MORE insulin
9. Eventually cells respond, but it took 5-10x normal insulin

You end up with high insulin and high blood sugar. Your pancreas is working overtime. Your cells are starving despite plenty of glucose in your blood.

## The Real Cause: PUFA-Loaded Membranes

Cell membranes are made of fats. The type of fat determines how insulin receptors work.

**Saturated fats:** Stable. Structured. Insulin receptors function normally.

**Polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs):** Unstable. Oxidize easily. Insulin receptors malfunction.

[When you eat seed oils, PUFAs incorporate into cell membranes](/blog/pufas-vs-saturated-fat). This changes the physical structure. The insulin receptor can't signal properly.

It's not that you have "too much insulin." It's that your cells can't hear the signal.

**The research is clear:**
- Animals fed PUFAs develop insulin resistance within weeks
- Animals fed saturated fat maintain insulin sensitivity
- Human studies show PUFA intake correlates with metabolic syndrome
- Replacing PUFAs with saturated fats improves insulin sensitivity

Sugar is irrelevant if your cell membranes are broken.

## What About Low-Carb Diets

Low-carb diets "work" for blood sugar by avoiding the problem, not fixing it.

If you don't eat glucose, your blood sugar stays low. Your insulin stays low. Your numbers look better.

But your cells are still insulin resistant. The membrane problem hasn't changed.

**What happens on long-term low-carb:**
- [Thyroid function drops (T3 conversion requires glucose)](/blog/seed-oils-and-thyroid)
- Body temperature falls
- Energy decreases
- Sleep worsens
- Women lose periods
- Men's testosterone drops
- You can't tolerate carbs anymore—even fruit spikes your blood sugar

You've created a different problem. Your metabolism is suppressed. You're in survival mode.

## The SugarSaint Approach

**Fix the membranes first.** [Eliminate seed oils completely](/blog/seven-day-pufa-purge). Switch to saturated fats: butter, coconut oil, ghee, animal fats.

**Give it time.** Cell membranes turn over slowly. It takes 2-3 months for PUFAs to clear and saturated fats to rebuild membranes.

**Reintroduce carbohydrates gradually.** Start with easily digestible carbs: fruit, potatoes, white rice, honey. Your cells will start responding to insulin properly.

**Track your signals.** [Body temperature should climb toward 98°F](/blog/temperature-tracking-metabolism). [Pulse should strengthen to 75-85 bpm](/blog/pulse-tracking-guide). Energy improves. You feel warmer.

Most people find they can eat carbs without blood sugar issues once membranes are rebuilt. The "carb intolerance" was PUFA-induced insulin resistance, not a permanent condition.

## What About Type 2 Diabetes

Type 2 diabetes is advanced insulin resistance. Your pancreas has been making excess insulin for years. It's exhausted. Now you have high blood sugar AND low insulin production.

Eliminating PUFAs still helps. Insulin sensitivity improves. Your pancreas doesn't have to work as hard.

But you may still need medication while healing. Work with your doctor. Monitor your blood sugar closely. Many people reduce or eliminate diabetes medication over 6-12 months of PUFA elimination.

This isn't a quick fix. It's rebuilding cellular function.

## What You Notice as Insulin Sensitivity Improves

**You can eat carbs without crashing.** Fruit doesn't spike your blood sugar. You feel energized after eating, not tired.

**You're less hungry.** Insulin resistance causes constant hunger. As cells get glucose efficiently, hunger normalizes.

**Energy is stable.** No afternoon crashes. No need for constant snacking.

**You lose fat more easily.** High insulin prevents fat loss. As insulin normalizes, weight drops without calorie restriction.

**Fasting blood sugar improves.** Should be 75-95 mg/dL. If you were over 100, it comes down.

**HbA1c normalizes.** Reflects average blood sugar over 3 months. Should be under 5.5%.

These changes take time. Weeks to months, not days.

## FAQ

**Q: Should I never eat sugar?**
A: Sugar (glucose, fructose, sucrose) is a useful fuel when your metabolism works. Eliminate PUFAs first. Then eat carbohydrates to support thyroid and energy. Fruit, potatoes, rice, honey are all beneficial for most people.

**Q: What about fructose being bad for the liver?**
A: Fructose only causes problems in the context of PUFA-induced metabolic dysfunction. With healthy cell membranes, the liver processes fructose normally. Fruit has never caused fatty liver disease in populations without seed oil consumption.

**Q: I'm diabetic. Can I eat carbs on this approach?**
A: Work with your doctor. Start with PUFA elimination while monitoring blood sugar closely. As insulin sensitivity improves, you may be able to add carbs gradually. Don't change diabetes medication without medical supervision.

**Q: How do I know if I'm insulin resistant?**
A: Classic signs: high fasting blood sugar (over 95), high HbA1c (over 5.5%), high fasting insulin (over 10), difficulty losing weight despite calorie restriction, constant hunger, energy crashes after eating. Get labs. Track glucose at home if needed.

## THE SYSTEM (In 60 Seconds)

**Style:** Chuck Palahniuk (short sentences, punchy, direct) + Analogy Card + Ray Peat science

**Structure:**
1. Hook (2-4 paragraphs)
2. **üîç ANALOGY CARD** (visual box with the metaphor)
3. Literal explanations (what, how, why)
4. Practical instructions (what to do)
5. FAQ (3-5 questions)
6. Disclaimer
7. Single end CTA (course ‚Üí quiz)

**The Analogy Card does the conceptual work. The article does the practical work.**

## The Analogy Card (Quick Reference)

### Standard Template
```markdown
## üîç ANALOGY CARD

**Think of your metabolism like a house with a heating system:**

Your thyroid is the thermostat ‚Üí measures needs, sends signals
T3 is the electrical signal ‚Üí tells the furnace to fire
Your cell membranes are the wiring ‚Üí carries the signal
Your mitochondria are the furnace ‚Üí produces heat when signal arrives

**The problem:** PUFAs corrode the wiring. The thermostat works. The signal
is sent. But the furnace never gets the message. Your house stays cold.

**The fix:** Replace the corroded wiring. Clear signal path. Heat returns.
```

### Placement
**After the hook, before detailed explanations** (early in article)

### Why It Works
- Compartmentalizes the metaphor in one place
- Reader can reference it or skip it
- Rest of article stays practical
- No over-explaining the analogy

## Palahniuk Rules (Quick List)

‚úÖ **Short sentences** (max 15 words)
‚úÖ **Second person** ("You wake up tired. You drink coffee.")
‚úÖ **No hedging** (cut "might," "could," "possibly")
‚úÖ **Active voice** ("PUFAs block T3" not "T3 is blocked")
‚úÖ **Fragments OK** ("Done." "That's it." "There it is.")
‚úÖ **Read aloud** (should sound like someone talking)

‚ùå **No thought verbs** ("You think you're tired" ‚Üí "You're tired")
‚ùå **No academic hedging** ("Some research suggests..." ‚Üí "Studies show...")
‚ùå **No explaining analogies** (trust the reader to get it)

---

## Ray Peat Integration (Quick List)

‚úÖ **Brief references** (1-2 sentences max)
‚úÖ **After you've explained** (analogy first, validation second)
‚úÖ **Paraphrase concepts** (don't over-quote)
‚úÖ **Use as authority** ("Ray Peat documented..." "Peat emphasized...")

**Key Peat Concepts to Reference:**
- PUFAs suppress metabolism by interfering with thyroid at cellular level
- Temperature tracking as metabolic indicator (97.8¬∞F minimum)
- Saturated fats are stable, don't oxidize like PUFAs
- Carbs support T4 to T3 conversion
- Self-experimentation > studies

## Universal Article Elements

Every article, regardless of length, must have:

1. **TL;DR** (40-60 words at top)
2. **Analogy Card** (placed early)
3. **Q&A headings** (H2/H3 as questions)
4. **FAQ section** (3-5 questions)
5. **Disclaimer** ("This isn't medical advice. I'm not your doctor...")
6. **Single end CTA** (course primary, quiz secondary)
7. **Schema markup** (Article + FAQPage minimum)
8. **Internal links** (2-3 per article)
9. **EU/German notes** where relevant

---

## Three Article Lengths

### Short (800-1,200 words)
- Tactical, action-oriented
- Simplified Analogy Card (3 mappings)
- Quick wins, scannable

**Example topics:**
- "How to Identify Hidden PUFAs"
- "5 Seed Oils to Avoid"
- "Quick Guide to Restaurant Dining"

### Medium (1,500-2,500 words)
- Educational + actionable
- Full Analogy Card (4-5 mappings)
- Explains mechanism + application

**Example topics:**
- "Seed Oils and Thyroid"
- "Temperature Tracking for Metabolism"
- "PUFAs and Inflammation"

### Deep (3,000+ words)
- Foundational pillar content
- Comprehensive Analogy Card (or multiple cards)
- Evidence, objections, full protocol

**Example topics:**
- "PUFAs vs. Saturated Fat: Complete Guide"
- "The Science of Metabolic Rate"
- "Complete PUFA Elimination Protocol"

## Writing Process (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Choose Topic & Analogy
- What concept are you explaining?
- Which analogy fits best? (See `analogy-templates.md`)
- Can you map all key elements to the analogy?

### 2. Draft the Analogy Card
- Intro statement (the comparison)
- 3-5 mappings (concept ‚Üí familiar thing ‚Üí explanation)
- Problem (what goes wrong in analogy terms)
- Fix (how to solve it in analogy terms)

### 3. Write the Hook
- 2-4 paragraphs
- Show the reader they have a problem
- Make them curious about the solution
- Second person, short sentences

### 4. Place the Card
- Right after the hook
- Before you dive into explanations

### 5. Write Body Sections
- Stay literal after the card
- Don't keep referencing the analogy
- Q&A style headings
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Specific examples
- Internal links (2-3)

### 6. Add FAQ
- 3-5 common questions
- Short answers (2-3 sentences each)
- Address objections

### 7. Add Disclaimer
- "This isn't medical advice. I'm not your doctor..."

### 8. Add CTA
- Course primary ($297)
- Quiz secondary
- Clean, single block at end

### 9. Add Schema Markup
- Article schema (title, description, author, date)
- FAQPage schema (all FAQ questions)
- HowTo schema if applicable
- Dataset schema if applicable

### 10. Quality Check
- Read aloud (does it sound natural?)
- Check sentence length (under 15 words?)
- Verify Analogy Card placement (early?)
- Confirm no over-use of analogy after card
- Internal links present?
- Ray Peat referenced appropriately?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå Over-Using the Analogy
**DON'T:**
"As we said in the analogy, PUFAs are like rust in the wiring..."

**DO:**
"PUFAs oxidize and make membranes rigid. T3 can't pass through."

### ‚ùå Mixing Metaphors
**DON'T:**
"Your thyroid is a thermostat, but PUFAs are like rust in your engine..."

**DO:**
Pick one analogy. Put it in the card. Stick with it.

### ‚ùå Academic Hedging
**DON'T:**
"Some researchers suggest that PUFAs may potentially interfere..."

**DO:**
"PUFAs block thyroid hormone at the cellular level."

### ‚ùå Long Sentences
**DON'T:**
"Your body needs glucose to convert T4 into T3, which is the active form of thyroid hormone that tells your mitochondria to produce ATP."

**DO:**
"Your body needs glucose to convert T4 to T3. T3 is the active form. It tells your mitochondria to make energy."

### ‚ùå Explaining the Analogy
**DON'T:**
"Your cell membrane is like a door (meaning it's a barrier that controls what enters)..."

**DO:**
"Your cell membrane is a door ‚Üí controls what enters and exits"

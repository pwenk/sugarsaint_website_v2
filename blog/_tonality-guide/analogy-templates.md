## Template 1: Metabolism as a Fire

**Central Comparison:** Your metabolism = a fire that produces heat

### Key Mappings
- **Fuel** = food (fats, carbs, protein)
- **Oxygen** = thyroid hormone, cellular respiration
- **Heat** = energy, body temperature
- **Smoke** = inflammation, oxidative stress
- **Dry wood** = saturated fats (burns clean)
- **Wet wood** = PUFAs (smokes without heat)
- **Kindling** = glucose/carbs (easy ignition)

### Article Flow
1. **Hook**: Your fire is barely burning. Lots of smoke. No heat.
2. **Working system**: Dry wood + oxygen = clean flame + warmth
3. **What breaks it**: Wet wood (PUFAs) = smoke without heat
4. **Result**: You're cold despite "burning" calories
5. **Solution**: Replace wet wood with dry wood, add kindling

### Example Sentences
```
Your metabolism is a fire. Good fuel makes a clean flame. Heat without smoke.

But PUFAs are wet wood. They smolder. Lots of smoke. Inflammation. Free radicals.
Little heat. You burn calories but stay cold.

Saturated fats are dry wood. They catch fast. Burn clean. Heat without smoke.

Glucose is kindling. Gets the fire started. Keeps it burning steady.
```

### Ray Peat Connection
Peat often described metabolism as oxidation (controlled burning). He emphasized that efficient metabolism produces heat (CO2) without excessive oxidative stress (smoke/free radicals).

## Template 2: Cell Membranes as Doors

**Central Comparison:** Cell membrane = door that controls entry/exit

### Key Mappings
- **Door** = cell membrane
- **Lock** = receptor sites
- **Key** = hormones (T3, insulin, etc.)
- **Hinges** = membrane fluidity
- **Rust** = oxidized PUFAs
- **Oil for hinges** = saturated fats
- **Room inside** = mitochondria/energy production

### Article Flow
1. **Hook**: You have the key. But the door won't open.
2. **Working system**: Key slides in, lock turns, door opens easily
3. **What breaks it**: Rust in the hinges (PUFAs in membrane)
4. **Result**: Key works but door is jammed
5. **Solution**: Clear the rust, oil the hinges

### Example Sentences
```
Your cell membrane is a door. T3 is the key. Energy production is the room inside.

When the door works, the key slides in. Click. Lock turns. T3 enters.

But PUFAs rust the hinges. The door sticks. Key fits but won't turn.

Your thyroid makes the key. It's in your blood. But your cells are locked out.

Clear the rust. Oil the hinges with saturated fats. The door opens again.
```

### Ray Peat Connection
Peat emphasized membrane composition determining cellular function. Saturated fats make fluid membranes. PUFAs make rigid, oxidation-prone membranes.

## Template 3: Mitochondria as Power Plants

**Central Comparison:** Mitochondria = power plants producing electricity

### Key Mappings
- **Power plant** = mitochondria
- **Fuel** = glucose, fatty acids
- **Electricity** = ATP
- **Power lines** = cell membranes, blood vessels
- **Grid** = your body's energy distribution
- **Clean fuel** = saturated fats, glucose
- **Contaminated fuel** = oxidized PUFAs
- **Blackout** = energy crash

### Article Flow
1. **Hook**: Your power keeps cutting out. The plant is running. But lights still flicker.
2. **Working system**: Clean fuel → efficient production → steady power
3. **What breaks it**: Contaminated fuel clogs the system
4. **Result**: Brownouts, surges, inconsistent energy
5. **Solution**: Switch to clean fuel, maintenance clears the system

### Example Sentences
```
Your mitochondria are power plants. They burn fuel to make ATP. Electricity for
your cells.

Clean fuel in. Steady power out. Lights stay on. You have energy all day.

But contaminated fuel clogs the turbines. Incomplete combustion. The power
surges and drops.

You're tired. Then wired. Then exhausted again. Brownouts.

Switch to clean fuel. Saturated fats burn without residue. The power stabilizes.
```

### Ray Peat Connection
Peat described mitochondrial function as determining metabolic rate. Efficient respiration produces ATP and heat. Inefficient respiration produces oxidative stress and less energy.

## Template 4: Body as a House (Temperature Regulation)

**Central Comparison:** Your body = a house with a heating/cooling system

### Key Mappings
- **House** = your body
- **Thermostat** = thyroid
- **Furnace** = mitochondria
- **Wiring** = cell membranes, hormone transport
- **Heating signal** = T3 hormone
- **Temperature reading** = waking body temp
- **Rust in wiring** = PUFAs blocking signal

### Article Flow
1. **Hook**: Thermostat says 72°F but you're freezing
2. **Working system**: Thermostat → signal → furnace → heat
3. **What breaks it**: Jammed wiring between thermostat and furnace
4. **Result**: Signal sent but never received
5. **Solution**: Clear the wiring, signal gets through

*(This is the analogy used in the full example article)*

### Ray Peat Connection
Peat advocated temperature tracking as the most reliable metabolic indicator. He documented how PUFAs interfere with thyroid signaling despite "normal" lab values.

## Template 5: Food Quality as Building Materials

**Central Comparison:** Food = construction materials for building/maintaining your body

### Key Mappings
- **Your body** = building under constant renovation
- **Cells** = individual rooms/structures
- **Food** = building materials
- **Quality materials** = whole foods, saturated fats, protein
- **Cheap materials** = seed oils, processed foods
- **Foundation** = bone, connective tissue
- **Walls** = cell membranes
- **Decay** = aging, disease

### Article Flow
1. **Hook**: You're renovating your house with cheap materials. It looks okay today.
2. **Working system**: Quality materials → strong structure → lasts decades
3. **What breaks it**: Cheap materials break down fast
4. **Result**: Constant repairs, accelerated decay
5. **Solution**: Use quality materials, structure stabilizes

### Example Sentences
```
Your body rebuilds itself constantly. Every cell replaced over months or years.

The materials matter. Build with quality. Your structure lasts.

But seed oils are particle board. Looks fine today. Warps tomorrow. Crumbles
next year.

Saturated fats are hardwood. Stable. Strong. Lasts decades.

You choose your materials every meal. Choose quality. Your body thanks you later.
```

### Ray Peat Connection
Peat emphasized that dietary fats literally become your cell membranes. Quality inputs = quality structure. Poor inputs = degraded function over time.

## Template 6: Inflammation as Fire Alarm

**Central Comparison:** Inflammation = fire alarm system responding to threats

### Key Mappings
- **Fire alarm** = inflammatory response
- **Real fire** = actual tissue damage, infection
- **False alarm** = chronic inflammation from PUFAs
- **Smoke detector** = immune cells
- **Alarm fatigue** = chronic inflammation desensitization
- **Reset button** = anti-inflammatory interventions

### Article Flow
1. **Hook**: Your fire alarm won't stop beeping. But there's no fire.
2. **Working system**: Real threat → alarm → response → resolution
3. **What breaks it**: Constant false alarms from oxidized fats
4. **Result**: Always inflamed, can't tell real threats from false
5. **Solution**: Remove false trigger, system recalibrates

### Example Sentences
```
Your immune system is a fire alarm. Detects threats. Sounds the warning. You
respond.

When it works: real fire → alarm → you grab the extinguisher → fire out →
alarm stops.

But PUFAs set off false alarms constantly. Oxidized fats trigger inflammation.
All day. Every day.

The alarm never stops. You can't tell what's real anymore. Everything hurts.

Remove the false trigger. Eliminate oxidized fats. The alarm resets. You hear
clearly again.
```

### Ray Peat Connection
Peat linked chronic inflammation to PUFA oxidation. He described it as the body's stress response to damaged fats constantly triggering immune reactions.

## Template 7: Blood Sugar as Fuel Gauge

**Central Comparison:** Blood sugar = fuel gauge showing available energy

### Key Mappings
- **Fuel tank** = glycogen stores
- **Fuel gauge** = blood sugar level
- **Refilling** = eating carbs
- **Running on fumes** = hypoglycemia
- **Fuel efficiency** = metabolic flexibility
- **Engine knock** = stress hormones, adrenaline spike
- **Smooth running** = stable blood sugar

### Article Flow
1. **Hook**: Your fuel gauge swings wildly. Full tank to empty in an hour.
2. **Working system**: Steady refueling → stable gauge → smooth ride
3. **What breaks it**: Skipping meals, wrong fuel type
4. **Result**: Energy crashes, stress response, cortisol spikes
5. **Solution**: Frequent refueling with quality fuel

### Example Sentences
```
Your blood sugar is your fuel gauge. Shows how much energy you have available.

Full tank: clear thinking, steady energy, warm body. You cruise.

Empty tank: shaky hands, brain fog, cold sweat. You're running on stress hormones.

But stress hormones are emergency fuel. Adrenaline. Cortisol. Burns dirty. Leaves
residue.

Keep the tank topped up. Small meals. Fruit. Juice. Honey. You run smooth.
```

### Ray Peat Connection
Peat emphasized adequate carbohydrate intake for stress reduction. Stable blood sugar reduces cortisol. Lower stress = better thyroid function = higher metabolism.

## Template 8: Hormones as Messengers

**Central Comparison:** Hormones = postal service delivering messages

### Key Mappings
- **Sender** = glands (thyroid, adrenals, etc.)
- **Letter/package** = hormone molecule
- **Address** = receptor on cell
- **Delivery** = hormone binding to receptor
- **Message inside** = genetic instruction
- **Mail carrier** = blood circulation
- **Blocked mailbox** = PUFA-jammed receptors
- **Return to sender** = hormone can't bind

### Article Flow
1. **Hook**: Your mailbox is full. Letters pile up. But you never get the message.
2. **Working system**: Send → deliver → open → read → act
3. **What breaks it**: Blocked mailbox, carrier can't deliver
4. **Result**: Message sent but never received
5. **Solution**: Clear the mailbox, messages get through

### Example Sentences
```
Hormones are letters. Your glands write them. Your blood delivers them. Your
cells read them.

When it works: thyroid writes "make energy" → blood delivers → cell reads →
mitochondria respond.

But PUFAs block the mailbox. Letters arrive. Can't get in. They pile up.

Your thyroid keeps writing. Your blood keeps delivering. But cells never read
the message.

Clear the mailbox. Remove the oxidized fats blocking the slot. Messages get
through again.
```

### Ray Peat Connection
Peat described hormone resistance not as receptor damage but as membrane interference. The hormone and receptor are fine. The membrane prevents them from connecting.

## How to Choose the Right Analogy

### Match analogy to article focus:

**Talking about energy production?** → Fire or Power Plant
**Talking about hormone signaling?** → Door/Lock or Messengers
**Talking about body temperature?** → House/Thermostat
**Talking about inflammation?** → Fire Alarm
**Talking about blood sugar?** → Fuel Gauge
**Talking about long-term health?** → Building Materials

### Test your analogy:

1. **Can you map ALL key concepts?** If you can't explain the mechanism through the analogy, pick a different one.
2. **Is it familiar?** Readers should instantly understand the analogy without explanation.
3. **Does it extend?** Can you use it for the whole article without breaking?
4. **Is it visceral?** Does it make them FEEL the problem?

### Red flags:

❌ Switching analogies mid-article
❌ Mixing literal and metaphorical language confusingly
❌ Explaining the analogy instead of trusting it
❌ Choosing an analogy readers won't understand

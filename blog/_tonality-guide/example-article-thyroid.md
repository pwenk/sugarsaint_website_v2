# Seed Oils and Thyroid: How PUFAs Influence Energy

## TL;DR

Your metabolism is a heating system. Your thyroid is the thermostat. T3 is the signal that tells the furnace to make heat. PUFAs jam the wiring between thermostat and furnace. The signal can't get through. Your house stays cold. Swap seed oils for saturated fats. The wiring clears. Heat returns.

Your house is cold.

You check the thermostat. Says 72°F. You bump it to 75. Nothing happens.

You call a technician. He tests the thermostat. "Working fine," he says. "Reads normal."

But you're still freezing.

This is your thyroid.

The gland works. The hormone is in your blood. Your lab results say "normal." But your cells aren't getting the signal. They're not making heat.

Something is blocking the wire between the thermostat and the furnace.

That something is seed oils.

## What Your Thyroid Actually Does

Your thyroid is the thermostat. It measures your energy needs. It sends out hormones to match the demand.

Two hormones. T4 and T3.

T4 is storage. The signal on standby. T3 is active. The signal that tells your mitochondria to make energy.

Think of T3 as the electrical signal running from your thermostat to your furnace. When it arrives, the furnace fires. Heat pumps through your house. You stay warm.

More T3 in your cells means more energy production. Your body temperature rises. 97.8°F or higher when you wake up. Your pulse is strong. 75 to 85 beats per minute.

Less T3 means the furnace barely runs. Your body temperature drops. Under 97.8°F. Your pulse is weak. Under 70 bpm.

You can measure this. Digital thermometer. First thing when you wake up. Before you stand up. Under your tongue.

Your temperature doesn't lie.

## How Seed Oils Jam the Wiring

Seed oils are polyunsaturated fats. PUFAs. Multiple double bonds make them chemically unstable.

They oxidize. Constantly. When exposed to heat, light, oxygen. Which is every second they're in your body.

Oxidized PUFAs get stuck in your cell membranes. Your membranes are the walls around your cells. The barrier that controls what gets in and out.

When PUFAs dominate your membrane, it changes. The membrane gets stiff. Rigid. Less fluid.

Now T3 can't enter the cell.

It's like someone drove rusty nails through the wire between your thermostat and furnace. The thermostat sends the signal. The wire can't carry it. The furnace never gets the message.

Ray Peat spent decades researching this mechanism. He documented how polyunsaturated fats inhibit thyroid hormone at the cellular level. Not by shutting down the gland. By interfering with the hormone's ability to reach the mitochondria.

The thermostat works. The signal is sent. But the wiring is jammed.

This is why your labs look normal but you feel hypothyroid. Cold hands. Low energy. Brain fog. Weight gain. Hair thinning.

Your doctor tests the thermostat. "It's working fine."

But nobody's checking the wiring.

## Your House Runs Cold

You wake up exhausted. You need coffee just to think. By 3 PM you're useless.

Your hands are cold. Even in summer. You wear layers when everyone else is comfortable.

You eat the same calories you always ate. You gain weight anyway.

You sleep eight hours. You wake up tired.

This is a furnace that's barely running. Your thermostat is screaming for heat. Your T3 levels might look "normal" on bloodwork. But the signal isn't reaching your cells.

The furnace gets intermittent power. It kicks on. It shuts off. It never runs full blast.

You survive. But you don't thrive.

And everyone tells you it's stress. Or age. Or you need antidepressants.

It's none of that.

It's the canola oil in your salad dressing. The soybean oil in your bread. The sunflower oil in your "healthy" granola.

## Where the Rust Comes From

Every restaurant cooks in seed oils. Canola. Soybean. "Vegetable" oil.

Why? It's cheap. It doesn't smoke at high heat. It has no flavor.

Meaning it doesn't interfere with the food. But it interferes with your cells.

Your salad dressing. Soybean oil with herbs and vinegar.

Your protein bar. Sunflower oil to hold it together.

That jar of almond butter with "one simple ingredient." Check again. "Roasted almonds, palm oil, cane sugar, sea salt." Someone added oil to keep it smooth.

Packaged cookies. Crackers. Chips. Frozen meals. Restaurant food. Fast food. Coffee shop pastries.

All fried or baked or processed with seed oils.

In the EU, labels are clearer. They have to list the specific oil. "Sunflower oil" or "rapeseed oil." In the US, they hide behind "vegetable oil."

But even in Germany or Austria, restaurants still use the cheap stuff. Ask your server what oil they cook with. Most will tell you. Some won't know. That tells you enough.

You're soaking your cells in oxidized fats every day. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks.

The rust accumulates. The wiring degrades. The signal weakens.

Your furnace runs colder every year.

---

## Fix the Wiring

Stop eating seed oils. Two weeks minimum.

No canola. No soybean. No corn, sunflower, safflower, grapeseed, or rice bran oil.

Cook with butter. Coconut oil. Ghee. Beef tallow. These fats are saturated. Stable. They don't oxidize.

Think of saturated fats as copper wiring. Clean. Conductive. The signal flows through.

Eat enough carbohydrates. Glucose supports the conversion of T4 to T3. Your body needs sugar to activate the thyroid hormone. Not processed junk. Fruit. Potatoes. Rice. Honey.

Ray Peat emphasized this: low-carb diets often suppress thyroid function. The body interprets carb restriction as stress. It slows metabolism to conserve resources.

You need fuel to make heat.

Track your temperature and pulse every morning. Same time. Same method. Under your tongue. Write it down.

Week one: you might feel worse. You're clearing the rust. Your body is dumping stored PUFAs. You might feel irritable. Tired. Headachy.

Push through.

Week two: you wake up easier. Your hands feel warmer. Your energy stabilizes. No more 3 PM crash.

Week three: your temperature climbs. 97.8°F. Then 98.0. Then 98.2. Your pulse strengthens. 75 bpm. Then 80.

The wiring clears. The signal reaches the furnace. Heat returns.

This isn't magic. It's removing the interference.

Your thyroid was working the whole time. You just had to let the signal through.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can seed oils cause thyroid disease?

Not directly. They don't destroy your thyroid gland. Hashimoto's and Graves' disease have different mechanisms. But PUFAs suppress thyroid function at the cellular level. Your labs might look normal while you feel hypothyroid. Different problem. Same symptoms.

### How long does it take to clear PUFAs from my body?

Your cell membranes turn over gradually. Some cells replace their membranes in weeks. Others take months. Fat tissue stores PUFAs long-term. Years, potentially. Most people notice improvement in two to four weeks. Full clearance takes longer.

### What about fish oil supplements?

Also polyunsaturated. Also unstable. Omega-3s oxidize faster than omega-6s. The capsules protect them until you open the bottle. Then they degrade. Fresh fatty fish is different. Comes packaged with antioxidants. Less oxidation. But watch your response. Track your temperature.

### Are olive oil and avocado oil okay?

Better than seed oils. Mostly monounsaturated. More stable. Extra virgin olive oil has polyphenols that protect against oxidation. But don't cook with it at high heat. Use it cold. For salads. Finishing dishes. Cook with saturated fats.

### What if I have diagnosed hypothyroidism?

This isn't a replacement for medication. If you take levothyroxine, keep taking it. Consult your doctor before changing anything. But eliminating seed oils might improve how well the medication works. Better cellular uptake. Better conversion of T4 to T3. Track your symptoms and temperature. Your doctor can adjust your dose based on how you respond.

### Extended Analogy (Thermostat/Furnace)
- Introduced in TL;DR and opening
- Every section reinforces it:
  - Thyroid = thermostat
  - T3 = electrical signal
  - Cell membrane = wiring
  - Mitochondria = furnace
  - PUFAs = rust/nails jamming the wires
  - Temperature/energy = heat output
- Never breaks the metaphor
- Technical concepts translated through analogy first

### Palahniuk Style
- Average sentence length: 8-12 words
- Second person throughout ("You wake up tired")
- No hedging ("might," "could," "possibly")
- Active voice ("PUFAs block T3" not "T3 is blocked")
- Rhythm: short-short-long pattern
- Repetition for emphasis ("Your hands are cold. Even in summer.")

### Ray Peat Integration
- Concepts paraphrased, not quoted extensively
- Used as scientific validation after analogy is clear
- References his research approach (decades of work, cellular mechanisms)
- Core ideas: PUFA oxidation, thyroid suppression, carb support, temperature tracking
- Positioned as expert authority without lecturing

### Practical Elements
- Specific numbers (97.8°F, 75-85 bpm)
- Timeline (week by week progression)
- EU/German notes integrated naturally
- Actionable steps (what to eat, what to track)
- FAQ addresses real objections

### Emotional Arc
- Opens with frustration (cold house, normal labs)
- Identifies enemy (seed oils)
- Explains mechanism (jammed wiring)
- Provides solution (clear the rust)
- Ends with hope (heat returns)

Solid medium-length piece. Could expand to 2,500+ by:
- Adding more specific food examples
- Including case study or personal story
- Expanding EU/restaurant survival tactics
- More detail on T4 to T3 conversion
- Deeper dive into specific types of PUFAs

Could trim to 1,200 for shorter version by:
- Cutting "Your House Runs Cold" section
- Condensing "Where the Rust Comes From"
- Shortening FAQ to 3 questions
- Removing some repetition

The analogy is the skeleton. Add or trim flesh as needed. But keep the thermostat metaphor throughout.

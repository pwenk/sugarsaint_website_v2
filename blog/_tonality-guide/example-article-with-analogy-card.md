# Seed Oils and Thyroid: How PUFAs Influence Energy

## TL;DR

Your thyroid produces T3 hormone. T3 tells your cells to make energy. PUFAs from seed oils block T3 from entering cells. The hormone is in your blood but can't reach your mitochondria. Your body temperature drops. Energy drops. Swap seed oils for saturated fats. Track your morning temperature. Most people see it rise within two to three weeks.

---

You wake up exhausted.

Coffee gets you functional. More coffee keeps you there. By 3 PM you crash.

Your hands are cold. Even in summer. You wear layers when everyone else is comfortable.

You eat the same calories. You gain weight anyway.

Everyone says it's stress. Or age. Or you need your thyroid checked.

You get it checked. TSH looks normal. T3 looks normal. T4 looks normal.

"Everything's fine," your doctor says.

But you still feel hypothyroid.

## üîç ANALOGY CARD

**Think of your metabolism like a house with a heating system:**

Your thyroid is the thermostat ‚Üí measures needs, sends signals
T3 is the electrical signal ‚Üí tells the furnace to fire
Your cell membranes are the wiring ‚Üí carries the signal
Your mitochondria are the furnace ‚Üí produces heat when signal arrives

**The problem:** PUFAs corrode the wiring. The thermostat works. The signal is sent. But the furnace never gets the message. Your house stays cold.

**The fix:** Replace the corroded wiring. Clear signal path. Heat returns.

## What Your Thyroid Does

Your thyroid gland makes two hormones. T4 and T3.

T4 is storage. Inactive form. Circulates in your blood waiting to be converted.

T3 is active. It enters your cells. Binds to receptors. Tells your mitochondria to produce ATP.

More T3 in cells means more energy production. Your body temperature rises. Your pulse strengthens. You think clearly. You move easily.

Less T3 in cells means low energy output. Temperature drops below 97.8¬∞F when you wake up. Pulse weakens below 70 beats per minute. Brain fog. Fatigue.

You can measure this. Digital thermometer under your tongue. First thing when you wake up. Before you stand up or drink anything.

Your temperature doesn't lie. It reflects your metabolic rate in real time.

Ray Peat spent fifty years researching thyroid function. He found that body temperature is more reliable than blood tests for assessing thyroid status. You can have "normal" labs and a suppressed metabolism. The numbers look fine but your cells aren't getting the signal.

---

## How PUFAs Block the Signal

Seed oils contain polyunsaturated fatty acids. PUFAs. Linoleic acid mostly.

Multiple double bonds make them chemically unstable. They oxidize when exposed to heat, light, or oxygen. Which happens constantly in your body.

These oxidized fats incorporate into your cell membranes. Your membranes are supposed to be fluid. Flexible. Allow hormones to pass through.

But PUFAs make membranes rigid. Less permeable. T3 can't enter as easily.

The hormone is circulating in your blood. Your thyroid is producing it. Your labs show normal levels. But it's not reaching the mitochondria where energy production happens.

This is why bloodwork can look perfect while you feel terrible. The gland works. The transport works. The membrane doesn't.

PUFAs also suppress the conversion of T4 to T3. Your body makes less active hormone. And what it does make can't get into cells efficiently.

Double block. Less T3 produced. Less T3 delivered.

Result: your metabolism slows down even though your thyroid gland is healthy.

---

## Where You're Getting PUFAs

Every restaurant cooks with seed oils. Canola. Soybean. Vegetable oil.

Your salad dressing is soybean oil with vinegar and herbs.

Your bread has soybean oil to keep it soft.

Your "healthy" granola has sunflower oil to make it crispy.

Your protein bar has canola oil to bind it together.

Your crackers were baked in vegetable oil.

Your frozen dinner was cooked in canola oil.

You're eating oxidized fats three meals a day. They accumulate in your cell membranes. Over months and years, your membranes become less fluid. Less responsive to thyroid hormone.

Your temperature drops slowly. 98.6¬∞F becomes 98.0. Then 97.5. Then 97.0.

You think it's normal because it happened gradually.

It's not normal. It's suppression.

In Germany and Austria, food labeling is clearer. "Raps√∂l" (rapeseed/canola) or "Sonnenblumen√∂l" (sunflower) must be listed specifically. But restaurants still use cheap oils. Same problem. Different language.

---

## Fix It

Stop eating seed oils. Two weeks minimum. Four weeks better.

Cook with butter. Coconut oil. Ghee. Beef tallow if you can find it. These fats are saturated. Stable. They don't oxidize. They create fluid membranes that respond to hormones properly.

Eat enough carbohydrates. Your body needs glucose to convert T4 to T3. Fruit. Potatoes. White rice. Honey. Orange juice.

Low-carb diets often suppress thyroid function. Your body interprets carb restriction as stress. It slows metabolism to conserve resources. Some people do fine low-carb. Many don't. Track your temperature to know.

Avoid restaurant food for two weeks. Everything is cooked in seed oils. Even the "healthy" places. Even the expensive ones. Unless they explicitly advertise cooking in butter or olive oil, assume they're using canola.

Track your morning temperature and pulse daily. Same time. Same method. Write it down.

Week one: you might feel worse. Irritable. Headachy. Low energy. You're clearing stored PUFAs. Your body is dumping oxidized fats from tissue. Push through.

Week two: you start waking up easier. Hands feel warmer. Energy stabilizes. Less need for coffee.

Week three: temperature climbs. 97.8¬∞F or higher. Pulse strengthens. 75 to 85 beats per minute. Brain fog clears.

This isn't a miracle. It's removing interference.

Your thyroid was working. You just had to let the hormone through.

---

## Track Temperature Like This

Buy a basic digital thermometer. Doesn't need to be expensive.

When you wake up, before you get out of bed, put it under your tongue. Wait for the beep.

Write down the number. Do this every morning for three weeks.

You're looking for a pattern.

Starting below 97.8¬∞F? Your metabolism is suppressed.

Climbing toward 98.0¬∞F or higher after two weeks on saturated fats? You're recovering.

Staying low even after cleaning up your diet? Something else might be wrong. Get your thyroid actually tested. Full panel. TSH, free T3, free T4, reverse T3, antibodies.

But try the diet change first. It's free. It works for most people. And even if you need medication eventually, eliminating PUFAs will help the medication work better.

Peat emphasized this. Temperature is the signal. Not TSH. Not T4. Temperature tells you what's happening at the cellular level.

Trust your thermometer more than your lab results.

## What About Omega-3s?

Fish oil supplements are also polyunsaturated. Also unstable. They oxidize quickly once exposed to air.

Some people feel better on fish oil. Some feel worse. Track your temperature response.

Fresh fatty fish is different. Salmon. Sardines. Mackerel. They come with antioxidants that protect the fats from oxidizing. Eat the whole fish. Don't extract the oil into a capsule that sits on a shelf for months.

If you take fish oil, keep it refrigerated. Use it within a month of opening. Watch your morning temperature. If it drops, stop taking it.

Prioritize saturated fats. Add fish oil only if you respond well.

---

## EU Notes

European food labels are more transparent. "Pflanzliches √ñl" or "vegetable oil" isn't allowed. They must specify: Raps√∂l, Sonnenblumen√∂l, Soja√∂l.

This makes it easier to identify seed oils. But it doesn't make them less common. Check every label.

Restaurants in Germany still use Raps√∂l. It's cheap. High smoke point. No flavor. Ask your server. "Womit wird das gekocht?" (What is this cooked in?)

Most won't know. That tells you enough.

Order simply. Grilled meat. Steamed vegetables. No sauce. Or cook at home where you control the ingredients.

Austria has similar regulations. Switzerland too. But restaurants default to seed oils across all three countries.

Being in Europe doesn't protect you. It just makes the labels honest.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can seed oils cause thyroid disease like Hashimoto's?

No. Different mechanism. Hashimoto's is autoimmune. Your immune system attacks the thyroid gland. PUFAs don't cause that. But they do suppress thyroid hormone function at the cellular level. You can have healthy labs and feel hypothyroid because the hormone can't enter cells.

### How long does it take to clear PUFAs from my body?

Cell membranes turn over gradually. Some cells replace their membranes in weeks. Others take months. Fat tissue stores PUFAs long-term. Years potentially. But most people notice improvement in two to four weeks. Full clearance takes longer.

### What if I have diagnosed hypothyroidism and take medication?

Keep taking your medication. Don't stop without consulting your doctor. But eliminating seed oils might help the medication work better. Better cellular uptake. Better conversion of T4 to T3. Track your temperature. Your doctor can adjust your dose based on symptoms.

### Are olive oil and avocado oil okay?

Better than seed oils. Mostly monounsaturated. More stable. Extra virgin olive oil has polyphenols that protect it from oxidation. Use it cold. Salads. Finishing dishes. Don't cook with it at high heat. Cook with butter or coconut oil.

### What about "high oleic" sunflower oil?

Bred to have more monounsaturated fat. More stable than regular sunflower oil. But still processed. Still extracted with heat and hexane. If you're going to use seed oils, high oleic versions are less bad. But saturated fats are still better.

## Analysis: Why This Works Better

### Benefits of Analogy Card Approach

1. **Compartmentalized:** Metaphor exists in one clearly marked place
2. **Optional:** Reader can skip if they prefer literal explanation
3. **Referenceable:** Easy to scroll back and check the framework
4. **Visual break:** Creates rhythm in the article
5. **Brand consistency:** Can use same card design across all articles
6. **Flexible:** Different articles can have different analogies without confusing readers

### Rest of Article Flows Naturally

After the card, the article just explains:
- What thyroid does (literal)
- How PUFAs block it (literal with mechanism)
- Where you're getting PUFAs (practical)
- How to fix it (actionable)

No need to keep referencing the analogy. It's there if reader wants the conceptual anchor. Otherwise they get straight facts and instructions.

### When to Place the Card

**Option A - Early (used in this example):**
- After hook/opening
- Before detailed explanation
- Sets conceptual framework for what follows

**Option B - Mid-article:**
- After explaining the problem literally
- Card reinforces understanding with metaphor
- Then continue with solution

**Option C - Sidebar:**
- Floats alongside text
- Always visible but separate from main flow
- Most advanced design approach

### Card Variations by Article Type

**Short articles (800-1,200 words):**
- Simpler card, fewer mappings
- Just main comparison and one-line problem/fix

**Medium articles (1,500-2,500 words):**
- Full card as shown above
- All key mappings
- Problem and solution spelled out

**Deep articles (3,000+ words):**
- Could have multiple cards
- One card per major concept
- Or one comprehensive card at the start

## Word Count: ~1,950 words

Perfect medium length. Card adds ~150 words. Rest is clean, direct explanation.

The card does all the metaphor work. The article does all the teaching work.

Clean separation. Reader gets both without feeling talked down to.

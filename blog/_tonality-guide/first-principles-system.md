# First Principles: Blog Content System
## Applying Elon Musk's 5-Step Algorithm

---

## Step 1: Question Requirements

### What are we ACTUALLY trying to achieve?

**Core goal:** 100 articles that get cited by AI engines and convert readers to course buyers.

**Let's question every requirement we set:**

❓ **Do we need 3 different article lengths?**
→ NO. One flexible template. Add or cut sections based on topic complexity.

❓ **Do we need elaborate Analogy Cards with 5 mappings?**
→ NO. One sentence. That's it. "Your metabolism is a house heating system. PUFAs jam the wiring."

❓ **Do we need universal elements (TL;DR, FAQ, disclaimer, CTA)?**
→ YES. These actually drive conversions and AEO.

❓ **Do we need separate folders for each article?**
→ NO. One folder. One file per article. Images in /images/[slug].

❓ **Do we need social media repurposing templates?**
→ NOT YET. Write the article first. Repurpose later if it performs.

❓ **Do we need elaborate style guides?**
→ NO. Short sentences. Second person. One analogy. Ray Peat quote. Done.

❓ **Do we need Ray Peat quotes?**
→ MAYBE. Only if they add credibility for that specific point. Not required.

## Step 2: Delete

### Remove everything that's not essential:

✂️ **DELETE: Three-tier article length system**
- One template. Scale up or down based on topic.

✂️ **DELETE: Elaborate Analogy Card component**
- Too complex. Too much design overhead.
- Replace with one italicized line.

✂️ **DELETE: Separate folders per article**
- Overcomplicated file structure.
- One folder, one file per article.

✂️ **DELETE: Social media repurposing templates upfront**
- Optimization before validation.
- Write article → see if it works → then repurpose.

✂️ **DELETE: 8 different analogy frameworks**
- Overthinking. Pick one per article. Move on.

✂️ **DELETE: "Quality checklist" with 20 items**
- Paralysis by analysis.
- Checklist: Does it read well? Does it teach something? Does it convert? Ship it.

---

## Step 3: Simplify

### What's left after deletion? THIS:

### The Absolute Minimum Article

```markdown
# [Title as Question]

## TL;DR
[40-60 words: what's the problem, what's the solution]

---

[Hook: 2-3 paragraphs showing the reader they have this problem]

*[One sentence analogy: "Your X is like Y. Z breaks it."]*

[Explanation: What's actually happening, literally]

[What to do about it: Practical steps]

[Evidence: Ray Peat or study if needed]

## FAQ

**Q: [Question]**
A: [Answer in 2-3 sentences]

**Q: [Question]**
A: [Answer in 2-3 sentences]

**Q: [Question]**
A: [Answer in 2-3 sentences]

---

*This isn't medical advice. You're responsible for your own body.*

---

**Want the complete system?** [Get the course - $297]

**Not sure?** [Take the quiz]
```

### That's it. Everything else is optional.

---

## Simplified Rules

### Writing Style
1. **Short sentences** (under 15 words when possible)
2. **Second person** (you, your)
3. **One analogy** (one sentence, italicized, early)
4. **Active voice**
5. **No hedging**

### Required Elements
1. Title (as question)
2. TL;DR (40-60 words)
3. Hook (show them they have the problem)
4. One-sentence analogy (italicized)
5. Explanation (what's happening)
6. Solution (what to do)
7. FAQ (3 questions minimum)
8. Disclaimer
9. CTA (course → quiz)

### Optional Elements
- Ray Peat quotes (only if they strengthen the point)
- Studies/citations (only if needed for credibility)
- EU/German notes (only if relevant to topic)
- Visuals (only if you have them)

---

## Step 4: Accelerate

### How to write faster:

**Template is fill-in-the-blank:**
1. Title: [How does X affect Y?]
2. TL;DR: [X does Y. Here's why. Here's what to do.]
3. Hook: [You have this symptom. Here's why.]
4. Analogy: [X is like Y. Z breaks it.]
5. Explain: [Here's the mechanism.]
6. Solution: [Do this. Track that. Watch what happens.]
7. FAQ: [3 questions you'll get asked]
8. Ship it.

**Batch writing:**
- Write 5 hooks in one session
- Write 5 explanations in one session
- Write 5 FAQs in one session
- Assemble later

**AI first draft:**
- Give AI the template
- Give AI the topic from CSV
- AI generates first draft
- You edit for voice (Palahniuk-ify it)
- You add analogy (one sentence)
- You add Ray Peat if needed
- Ship it

**Target speed:** 1 article per day once you have the rhythm

---

## Step 5: Automate (LATER)

### Don't automate yet. But when you do:

**After you've written 10-20 articles manually:**

1. **Auto-generate schema** from FAQ section
2. **Auto-populate metadata** (title, description, keywords)
3. **Auto-create social snippets** from TL;DR and hook
4. **Auto-suggest internal links** based on topic clusters
5. **Auto-format** (heading hierarchy, spacing, etc.)

**But not yet.** Simplify first. Get fast first. Automate last.

---

## The First Principles Template

### Use this. Nothing more.

```markdown
---
title: [Question format]
slug: [url-friendly-slug]
keyword: [primary keyword]
cluster: [topic cluster]
date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
---

# [Title]

## TL;DR

[40-60 words: Problem → Solution]

---

[2-3 paragraph hook: You have this problem. You've tried X. It didn't work. Here's why.]

*[One sentence analogy: Your X is like Y. Z jams it.]*

## [H2 as Question]

[Explanation of what's actually happening. 3-5 paragraphs. Short sentences. Second person.]

[Optional: Ray Peat reference or study if it strengthens the point]

## [H2 as Question: What do you do about it?]

[Practical steps. Numbered list or paragraphs. Specific. Actionable.]

1. Do this
2. Track that
3. Watch for these changes
4. Timeline: X happens in Y weeks

[Optional: EU/German note if relevant]

## FAQ

**Q: [Question]**
A: [Answer. 2-3 sentences.]

## Comparison: Before vs. After

### BEFORE (Over-Engineered)
- 3 article templates (short/medium/deep)
- Elaborate Analogy Card component
- 8 analogy frameworks to choose from
- Separate folder per article with subfolders
- Social media templates created upfront
- 20-item quality checklist
- Required Ray Peat quotes
- Schema markup manually coded
- 5+ "universal elements" required

**Result:** Paralysis. Takes 6+ hours to write one article.

### AFTER (First Principles)
- 1 template (scales based on topic)
- One sentence analogy (italicized)
- Pick analogy based on topic (intuitive)
- One folder, one file per article
- No social media until article proves itself
- 3-question checklist: Read well? Teach something? Convert? Ship.
- Ray Peat optional
- Schema auto-generated later
- 4 required elements: TL;DR, analogy, FAQ, CTA

**Result:** Clarity. Ship one article per day.

## The Real Checklist (3 Questions)

Before publishing, ask:

1. **Does it read well?** (Read aloud. If it sounds natural, it's good.)
2. **Does it teach something useful?** (Can reader take action after reading?)
3. **Does it convert?** (Is CTA clear? Is path to course obvious?)

If yes to all three: Ship it.

Everything else is optimization theater.

## Example Using Simplified System

### Topic: Seed Oils and Thyroid

```markdown
# How Do Seed Oils Affect Thyroid Function?

## TL;DR

Seed oils contain PUFAs that block thyroid hormone from entering your cells. The hormone is in your blood but can't reach your mitochondria. Your body temperature drops. Energy drops. Swap seed oils for butter. Track your morning temperature. It usually rises within 2-3 weeks.

---

You wake up exhausted. Coffee gets you to functional. More coffee keeps you there. By 3 PM you crash hard.

Your hands are cold even in summer. You gain weight eating the same calories. Your doctor tests your thyroid. "Everything's normal."

But you feel hypothyroid.

*Your metabolism is a house heating system. Your thyroid is the thermostat. T3 is the signal. PUFAs jam the wiring between thermostat and furnace. The signal can't get through.*

## Why Does This Happen?

Your thyroid makes T3. T3 tells your cells to make energy. More T3 in cells means more energy and heat.

But PUFAs from seed oils get stuck in your cell membranes. They oxidize. They make membranes rigid. T3 can't pass through easily.

Your thyroid works. The hormone is in your blood. Your labs look normal. But the hormone can't reach your mitochondria where energy happens.

Ray Peat documented this mechanism over decades. He found that body temperature reveals more than blood tests. You can have normal TSH and low cellular thyroid function.

Your temperature drops below 97.8°F when you wake up. That's suppressed metabolism.

## What Do You Do?

Stop eating seed oils. Two weeks minimum.

1. **Cut these:** Canola, soybean, sunflower, safflower, corn, grapeseed oil
2. **Cook with these:** Butter, coconut oil, ghee, beef tallow
3. **Eat carbs:** Your body needs glucose to convert T4 to T3. Fruit, potatoes, rice, honey.
4. **Track temperature:** Under your tongue every morning before you get up. Write it down.

Week 1: You might feel worse. You're clearing stored PUFAs.
Week 2: You wake up easier. Hands feel warmer.
Week 3: Temperature climbs to 97.8°F or higher. Energy stabilizes.

This isn't magic. It's removing the interference.

## FAQ

**Q: Can seed oils cause thyroid disease?**
A: Not directly. Hashimoto's and Graves' are autoimmune. PUFAs suppress thyroid function at the cellular level. Different mechanism. Similar symptoms.

**Q: How long does it take to clear PUFAs?**
A: Most people notice changes in 2-4 weeks. Full clearance takes months. Your fat tissue stores PUFAs long-term.

**Q: What if I take thyroid medication?**
A: Keep taking it. Don't stop without your doctor. But eliminating seed oils might help it work better. Track your temperature. Your doctor can adjust your dose.

**Word count:** ~550 words

**Time to write:** 30-45 minutes once you have the rhythm

**SEO/AEO optimized:** Yes (TL;DR, Q&A headings, FAQ)

**Conversion optimized:** Yes (clear CTA)

**Does it work?** Ship it and find out.

---

## Action Items

1. **Use the simplified template** (copy it)
2. **Pick a topic** from your CSV
3. **Write one article** using this system (no overthinking)
4. **Time yourself** (should take 1-2 hours max)
5. **Ship it**
6. **Repeat tomorrow**

After 10 articles, you'll have a rhythm. After 20, you'll be fast. After 50, you can consider automation.

But first: simplify, ship, iterate.

---

## Summary

**Before:** Complex system with multiple templates, elaborate components, 20-item checklists.

**After:** One template. One sentence analogy. Three questions: Read well? Teach? Convert? Ship it.

**Musk's algorithm applied:**
1. ✅ Questioned requirements (most weren't necessary)
2. ✅ Deleted parts (elaborate cards, multiple templates, complex file structure)
3. ✅ Simplified (one template, minimal required elements)
4. ✅ Accelerate (fill-in-the-blank, batch writing, AI first drafts)
5. ⏸️ Automate (later, after manual process is optimized)

**Result:** You can write 100 articles without drowning in process.

Now write.

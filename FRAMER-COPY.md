# FRAMER COPY & IMAGE RECOMMENDATIONS - SUGARSAINT

This document provides complete copy and image recommendations for the SugarSaint Framer homepage, designed to align with the course philosophy, tone, and Option 4 funnel strategy (Quiz → Free Module 1 → Email Sequence → Course Sale).

**Funnel Strategy:** Quiz-first lead generation with Module 1 as free lead magnet.

**Voice:** Direct, conversational, contrarian, educational (not preachy), specific data points, rhetorical questions, empowering.

**Use of "sugar/honey":** Sparingly (1-2 times maximum, only in hero or final CTA where it feels natural).

## **HERO SECTION - VERSION 1: "THE CONTRARIAN HOOK"**

### Copy:
**Eyebrow text** (12px, uppercase, gold):
```
WHAT IF EVERYTHING WAS BACKWARDS?
```

**Display headline** (72px, bold):
```
Stop Blaming Sugar.
Start Trusting Your Body.
```

**Subheadline** (20px, medium gray):
```
The real enemy isn't carbs. It's the PUFAs they never warned you about.
Discover the metabolic truth that 2,847 people have used to reclaim their energy.
```

**Primary CTA button**:
```
Take The 2-Minute Quiz
```

**Secondary CTA button** (outline style with play icon):
```
Watch The Truth
```

**Trust badge** (14px, gray with lightning bolt icon):
```
⚡ 94% report higher energy within 30 days
```

### Image:
- **Layout**: Split screen desktop (60% text left / 40% visual right)
- **Visual**: Before/after comparison
  - **Left side**: Tired/foggy person (grayscale or desaturated)
  - **Right side**: Energized person with subtle golden glow overlay
  - **Border radius**: 16px
  - **Shadow**: 0 8px 32px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)
- **Background**: Pure Cream (#FFFBF5) with Sacred Gold radial gradient (10% opacity) from top-right corner
- **Alternative**: Interactive slider component for before/after comparison
- **Mobile**: Stack vertically (text first, then simplified visual)

### Why This Works:
- **Pattern interrupt**: "Stop Blaming Sugar" challenges core belief
- **Specific social proof**: "2,847 people" feels real, not inflated
- **Clear villain**: PUFAs (creates curiosity gap)
- **Low-friction CTA**: Quiz, not $297 purchase

## **SECTION 2: PROBLEM STATEMENT**

### Copy:
**Eyebrow**:
```
THE OLD GOSPEL WAS WRONG
```

**H2**:
```
They told you sugar was poison.
They sold you "heart-healthy" oils.
They destroyed your metabolism.
```

**Body** (3 paragraphs, 18px):
```
For 50 years, the nutrition establishment blamed sugar and carbs for metabolic disease—while seed oil consumption increased 1000% in the American diet.

Look at the data: from 1999-2013, sugar consumption DECREASED by 23%. But obesity rates? They kept climbing. If sugar causes obesity, how do we explain that?

Here's what actually happened: In 1970, the American Heart Association told everyone to stop eating saturated fat (butter, lard, coconut oil) and switch to "heart-healthy" vegetable oils. That's when the obesity epidemic started. The real enemy isn't glucose. It's the PUFAs—polyunsaturated fatty acids in seed oils—that damage your mitochondria and wreck your thyroid function at the cellular level.
```

### Image:
- **Option 1**: Before/after pantry comparison
  - **Left**: Bottles of seed oils (canola, vegetable, soybean) with red X marks
  - **Right**: Safe fats (coconut oil, butter, ghee) with gold checkmarks
  - **Style**: Clean product photography on white background, minimal
- **Option 2**: Simple line chart showing sugar consumption vs obesity rates (1970-2013)
  - **Data**: Sugar line going DOWN, obesity line going UP
  - **Color scheme**: Gray for sugar line, Sacred Gold for obesity line (ironic reversal)
  - **Background**: White or Soft Sage card
- **Style**: Educational, data-driven, not fear-mongering

— Sarah K., Yoga Instructor
```

**Testimonial 3**:
```
"My testosterone went from borderline low to optimal range in 8 weeks. My doctor was shocked. I just eliminated seed oils and started listening to my body signals instead of experts."

— James R., Entrepreneur
```

**Testimonial 4**:
```
"Hair regrowth in thinning areas after 6 months. My dermatologist asked what I was doing. I told her: stopped the 'heart-healthy' oils, added carbs back. She thought I was insane. My hair disagrees."

— David M., 42

## **SECTION 8: THE PHILOSOPHY**

### Copy:

**Background**: Soft Sage (#E8F0E8) or Pure Cream with gold divider above

```
"This isn't a diet. It's a practice—a way of developing awareness and trust in your own body.

Your body is the authority. Not experts. Not studies. Not gurus.

When you eliminate PUFAs and provide adequate glucose, your metabolism can finally do what it's designed to do: produce optimal thyroid hormones, synthesize testosterone, maintain healthy body temperature, and support every cell in your body.

This isn't biohacking. It's removing the blocks."
```

**Attribution** (14px, medium gray):
```
— The SugarSaint Philosophy
```

## **SECTION 9: FAQ (OPTIONAL - ACCORDION STYLE)**

### Copy:

**Section H2** (centered):
```
Questions You Probably Have
```

**Accordion 1**:
**Q**: "Is this just another keto/low-carb diet?"
**A**: "No. In fact, we argue that low-carb diets damage your thyroid and metabolism long-term. This course teaches you to use glucose strategically—because your thyroid NEEDS carbs to function. You'll learn the difference between strategic carbs (fruit, rice, potatoes) and processed junk (HFCS + seed oils)."

**Accordion 2**:
**Q**: "Do I need to buy supplements?"
**A**: "No. Module 10 covers supplements, but the core message is: food first, always. Most supplements are a waste of money. We focus on eliminating what's damaging you (PUFAs) and adding what your body needs (glucose, saturated fats, micronutrients from whole foods)."

**Accordion 3**:
**Q**: "What if I'm already eating 'healthy'?"
**A**: "Most 'healthy' diets include seed oils (marketed as 'heart-healthy'), fear of carbs, and restriction-based thinking. If your body temperature is below 98°F, if you have afternoon energy crashes, or if you're cold all the time—your current approach isn't working. This course helps you understand why."

**Accordion 4**:
**Q**: "How long does it take to see results?"
**A**: "Most students report higher energy within 7-14 days of eliminating PUFAs. Body temperature increases typically show up in 3-4 weeks. Hormonal improvements (testosterone, thyroid optimization) take 6-12 weeks. Hair regrowth and other long-term benefits appear over months. This is healing, not a quick fix."

**Accordion 5**:
**Q**: "Is this backed by science?"
**A**: "Yes—but we also teach you to question 'the science.' Most nutrition research is funded by food companies, designed to produce garbage results, and based on flawed premises. We reference real data (like the sugar/obesity chart), bioenergetic principles from Ray Peat PhD, and cellular biology. But more importantly: we teach you to run YOUR OWN experiments. Your body's response is more valuable than any population study."

**Accordion 6**:
**Q**: "What if I have a specific health condition?"
**A**: "This course is educational, not medical advice. We teach principles (eliminate PUFAs, support thyroid, track body signals), not protocols for specific diseases. Many students see improvements in metabolic conditions (hypothyroidism, insulin resistance, hormonal imbalances), but you should work with your doctor if you have serious health issues. That said: your doctor probably told you to eat seed oils and avoid carbs. Question that, sugar."

### Design:
- **Accordion style**: Click to expand
- **Icons**: Gold plus/minus for expand/collapse
- **Background**: White cards on Cream background
- **Spacing**: 16px between accordions

---

## **OVERALL IMAGE STYLE GUIDELINES**

Based on your design system and course philosophy:

### ✅ **DO USE:**
- **Abstract energy/warmth imagery** (golden light, thermal glow, soft radiance)
- **Minimal line icons** (Sacred Gold, 2px stroke, Lucide/Phosphor sets)
- **Product mockups** (PDFs, spreadsheets, trackers with professional formatting)
- **Before/after comparisons** (pantry shelves, label comparisons—NOT bodies)
- **Infographics** (charts, timelines with gold accents)
- **Geometric shapes** (circles, soft edges, gold gradients)

### ❌ **DON'T USE:**
- Food photography (too literal, not aligned with philosophy)
- Body transformation photos (shallow, not what this is about)
- Clinical/medical imagery (white coats, stethoscopes)
- Overly literal metaphors (literal sugar cubes, etc.)
- Stock photos of people eating salads
- Anything that looks like a typical "diet program"

### **Visual Mood:**
- **Sacred minimalism** (less is more, white space is valuable)
- **Warm but scientific** (inviting but credible)
- **Abstract over literal** (suggestion over obviousness)
- **Gold accents** (use sparingly, 10-15% of design)

---

## **TONE REMINDERS**

When writing copy throughout the page:

- **Use "honey" or "sugar" 1-2 times MAX** (hero or final CTA only)
- **Be direct and conversational** ("They lied to you" not "Research suggests...")
- **Challenge dogma** ("What if everything was backwards?")
- **Empower, don't restrict** ("Discover what YOUR body needs")
- **No preaching** (you're a guide, not a guru)
- **Use contrarian angles** ("Stop blaming sugar")
- **Trust over authority** ("Your body knows more than any study")
- **Specific data points** (97.0°F → 98.2°F, 1000% increase in seed oils, 23% decrease in sugar)
- **Rhetorical questions** ("Sound familiar?", "What if that's backwards?")
- **Call out BS without being mean** ("Most nutrition science is garbage")
